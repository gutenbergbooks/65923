<span class="small">ON THE UPPER COLUMBIA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Along</span> the shores of one of the branches of the Upper Columbia,
a lad was making his way with a care and stealth
that showed he was on the alert for danger, let it come in
whatsoever form it chose.</p>

<p>A casual glance at the boy would have led one to pronounce
him about fifteen or sixteen years of age. He was
prepossessing and handsome to a remarkable degree. The
cheeks glowed with the hue of health, the rose-tint being as
fine as that of the sea-shell; the features were almost classical
in their regularity; the teeth small and clear as pearls, the
eyes large and lustrous, and the hair dark and wavy, but cut
quite short. The hands and feet were small and shapely, and
a certain careless grace of movement, shown even in his cautious
gait, proved that &#8220;Little Rifle,&#8221; as the lad was called,
possessed a rare activity, and an extraordinary command of
his bodily powers.</p>

<p>His dress was thoroughly backwoods in every respect, consisting
of the buck-skin leggings rather gaudily fringed and
ornamented, the moccasins embroidered with beads, the skirt
descending to the knees, and clasped at the waist by a broad
belt, into which was thrust a knife, the horn handle only being
visible. Within the bosom of the skirt, and out of sight,
was a small revolver, intended only to be used when necessity
compelled it. A string passing over one and under the other
shoulder, sustained a powder-flask and bullet-pouch; but
there was no game-bag visible, for the reason that the game
the hunters bring down in that latitude can not be carried
very conveniently, especially when the hunter is a boy in his
teens.</p>

<p>In the left hand Little Rifle carried a beaver-trap, while a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
small, silver-mounted rifle rested upon his right shoulder, and
was held in place by his other hand.</p>

<p>The day was drawing to a close, and there was a mellowed
subdued quiet resting upon wood and stream that made the
hour and the place one of the most attractive imaginable.
The branch of the Columbia, at this point, flowed quite swiftly
but with a steady, unruffled sweep, that was in perfect keeping
with silence and solitude. The banks on either hand
were varied by rock, wood and prairie, the country itself being
of the most romantic nature.</p>

<p>Looking off to the east and south, the eye caught a glimpse
of distant mountain peaks, standing out white and clear
against the blue horizon, like a snowy conical cloud, and the
intervening stretch of country was broken by hills, ravines,
gorges, wood, stream, rocks and prairie, in an interminable
jungle, making a country that was the chosen roaming-ground
of the fiercest wild animals, the most valuable game,
and the wild Indian, and the equally wild hunter and trapper.</p>

<p>Turning the eye to the westward, it was greeted with a
vision of magnificence and grandeur. In this clear, brilliant
air, which makes the climate of Oregon rival that of Italy,
there was a sharp, clear distinctness to the Cascade Range,
fifty miles away, that would have made any one believe that
the distance was scarcely a quarter. Some of the loftiest
peaks shone white against the sky, but as they towered aloft,
their immense slopes could be seen to be covered with verdure,
that was tinged with a misty blue, when viewed through
the half a hundred miles of atmosphere.</p>

<p>Little Rifle was moving up the left bank of the stream,
with his face turned toward the Cascade Range, except when
he darted his quick, wide-awake glances in the direction of
the river&#8217;s bank on his right hand, varied now and then by
an equally inquisitive look at the wood and rocks in front
and on his left.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle Ruff told me yesterday that there were plenty signs
of beaver further up the stream,&#8221; mused the lad, as he walked
along, &#8220;and I know that they have been thinned out down
below, so that I haven&#8217;t had a bite in this trap for three days.
I&#8217;ll set it a mile or two further up, where it will pay to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
it a visit early in the morning.&#8221; And he held up the trap
and turned it around before his eyes, as if it were a new thing
altogether. It resembled the ordinary &#8220;steel-trap,&#8221; except
that it was considerably larger.</p>

<p>The ease with which the lad carried the cumbersome load,
attested the strength which this manner of living had given
him. Like all little chaps, he was given to conversing with
himself, when walking alone, and to-day he seemed in quite
a chatty vein.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Ruff went off on a hunt yesterday, and told me he
would not be back for several days, and I&#8217;m to keep the old
cabin till he shows himself again. I&#8217;ve done that often
enough to understand it; but I wish he was home to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Something like a shade of sadness passed over the boy&#8217;s
face as he uttered these words. It may be that it was only
a natural feeling of loneliness; an evidence of that longing
for companionship, which, at times, comes over us all, and is
scarcely ever absent from youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder whether Uncle Ruff knows any more of my
life than he has told me,&#8221; he added, following up the vein of
thought. &#8220;That is little enough, at any rate. Years ago,
when I was very young, he found me, and hasn&#8217;t any more
idea than have I of who my parents are, and how it was I
came to be in this part of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little Rifle might have continued in this reverie for hours,
even after the sun had disappeared, but for the fact that his
surroundings prevented. That veteran of the Oregon woods,
known as Old Ruff Robsart, had not kept him under his
special training for years, without accomplishing something.
One of his lessons was that when a hunter was outside of his
cabin, or place of retreat, he should never go to sleep; which
in more intelligible language meant that &#8216;day-dreaming&#8217; or reverie,
of all things was to be avoided, and the true hunter or
trapper never failed to keep every faculty wide awake, on the
alert for insidious danger liable at any moment to leap out
upon him.</p>

<p>The lad had cast his glance several times toward the other
bank, and the result in each case appeared to be unsatisfactory.
There was something there which caused him considerable
speculation and misgiving.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>If we had been there, it is hardly possible that we should
have noticed it, but it could not escape the eye of the boy
trapper, who, walking more slowly each moment, finally came
to a dead halt, dropping the trap to the ground, and wheeling
about so as to face the suspicious point.</p>

<p>The stream to which we have alluded was about two hundred
yards in width. There were scarcely any trees at all
growing upon the opposite side at this particular position,
but there was an abundance of undergrowth and a species
of long high grass peculiar to the spot.</p>

<p>That which had arrested the reverie of Little Rifle was not
the suspicion, but the certainty that something was moving
along the bank, beneath the clustering grass. What it was
even he was unable to say. It had caught his eye, or rather
the indications of it had, when he was a short distance further
down-stream. An unnatural agitation of the grass was
the sign that caused him to scrutinize it with unwonted sharpness,
until, as we have already shown, he paused in his walk
and faced directly about.</p>

<p>It would seem, even with what he had learned, that there
was little cause for alarm, for there were many ways in which
the appearance could be explained. In the first place, as it
moved with the current, it might be that it was a log or
piece of driftwood that moved tardily, on account of its proximity
to shore, and the obstruction of the grass.</p>

<p>And then, if not an inanimate object, what more probable
than that it was some beast of prey stealing along in quest of its
victim?</p>

<p>Both of these considerations were in the mind of Little
Rifle, but were rejected after a moment&#8217;s thought. His life
had taught him to think quickly, and he was not long in
making up his mind that there was good cause for alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither logs nor animals travel in that style,&#8221; he muttered,
carefully following the agitated grass and undergrowth,
and watching intently for the chance when some inadvertence
would give him a more satisfactory glimpse of the object.
&#8220;It is either a white man or Indian, with the chances altogether
in favor of its being the Indian. We are too far up
in the mountains for white folks to give us much trouble, and
I remember that Uncle Ruff told me to be unusually careful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
for he had seen signs of Blackfeet both up and down-stream,
and if they have been hunting in these parts we can make up
our minds that they have found our traps, and are on a hunt
for us. I think that one of the Blackfeet is now in the
grass yonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wish of Little Rifle was gratified. He had stood but
a minute, when a mass of tall grass swayed to one side, and,
at the same instant, he saw the prow of a birch canoe stealing
as insidiously along as a panther approaches its prey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I thought!&#8221; exclaimed the lad. &#8220;It is one of
those Blackfeet, that Old Ruff says will follow a man a thousand
miles to get his scalp. I&#8217;ll bet he is after <i>mine</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whoever occupied the canoe&mdash;friend or foe&mdash;showed that
he was aware of the scrutiny to which he was subjected; for
the boat, which up to this time had progressed with unvarying
steadiness, now abruptly stood still.</p>

<p>This attempt to remove suspicion was too evident for the
lad to mistake it; and with a tact which proved not only
his remarkable training, but his native keenness, he took advantage
of the &#8220;situation,&#8221; with scarcely a second&#8217;s pause.</p>

<p>Picking up his trap, he wheeled half-way round, and
walked directly on among the undergrowth and rocks, and almost
immediately vanished from view. His action was precisely
that of one who was satisfied that nothing was wrong,
and who had resumed the quiet tenor of his way.</p>

<p>But exactly the opposite was the case. He was resolved
before venturing further up the stream to find out precisely
the nature of the danger that impended. It was one of the
maxims of old Robsart never to leave the presence of danger
until he had learned all about it.</p>

<p>This stealthy movement of the Blackfoot very probably had
a deep significance, which Little Rifle was determined to
penetrate, if such a thing were possible.</p>

<p>After walking a hundred yards, and reaching a point
where he felt secure from observation, he once more laid the
trap upon the ground, and examined his rifle. The latter was
a perfect weapon in its way, fitted to carry a ball a great
distance with accuracy and was just suited to the strength of
the lad. He handled it, too, like one who understood its
use, as indeed he did.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>Every thing seemed to be satisfactory, and in as perfect
order as he could desire.</p>

<p>&#8220;The gun is reliable,&#8221; was his satisfied exclamation, as he
threw it over his shoulder again; &#8220;now, if I ain&#8217;t mistaken,
there&#8217;s going to be trouble between a boy about my size,
and a Blackfoot Indian a good deal bigger!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.<br />


<span class="small">LITTLE RIFLE AND &#8220;BIG INJIN.&#8221;</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sun had long since passed down out of sight, behind
the Cascade Range, and a sort of twilight gloom rested upon
wood and river. Not a sound reached the ear, except the
faint hollow roar of the forest, and the distant rush of the
waterfall, where the river poured over the rocks on the way
to the ocean.</p>

<p>Little Rifle moved along with the careless stride of the
free easy-going hunter, who knows precisely where his footsteps
are leading him, and what he may expect when he gets
there. It was curious too to note the silence with which he
advanced. The most skillful trailer among the Blackfeet
could not have guided his moccasins with a softer rustle
that seemed more like the creeping of the reptile than the
motion of the human foot.</p>

<p>The boy did not approach the stream until he had reached
a point fully an eighth of a mile from where he had left it,
and then it was upon his hands and knees.</p>

<p>Reaching a spot that afforded him the view he was seeking,
he peered out from his concealment, directing his eyes
at once toward the place where he had last seen the canoe.
The distance was so great that even his young keen eyes
were unable to see any thing unusual for a moment. Suddenly,
however, he exclaimed in an excited whisper:</p>

<p>&#8220;There goes the old chap, as sure as the world, and he
thinks he is going to git <i>me</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, the canoe which had caused him so much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
uneasiness, shot out from the opposite side, and headed directly
across stream, the boat, as far as he was able to judge,
aiming for the spot where he had been standing.</p>

<p>Little Rifle waited hardly a minute after the canoe came
in sight, when he crawled hastily back for a rod or so, then
plunged into the protection of the shrubbery and undergrowth,
and retraced the very ground over which he had
passed but a few minutes before.</p>

<p>This time he went at all speed, for his object was to reach
the point ahead of the red-skin. He ran like a regular hunter,
with a long, loping trot, his feet sounding like the
stealthy tread of a beast of prey, while he kept glancing
from side to side in that fashion which seemed to characterize
him at all times during his waking hours.</p>

<p>Little Rifle was in good luck this afternoon, for he reached
his destination at the very second that he wished to do
so.</p>

<p>He heard the dip of the paddle, as the canoe made its
way through the swift current, and a moment later the
Blackfoot&#8217;s head came to view, as he propelled the canoe
swiftly forward. Entirely unsuspicious of danger, he ran the
prow of the boat hard against the shore and almost at the
same instant leaped out.</p>

<p>As Little Rifle was thus afforded a full view of the red-skin,
he was sure that he had never seen a more repulsive
creature on two legs. A dirty blanket lay in the bottom of
the canoe, and the hair, instead of being gathered in the ornamented
tuft or topknot, hung entirely loose and straggling
about his shoulders. The face itself was daubed and plastered
with differently colored clay, mixed with grease and some
other compound that made the copper-skin the very acme of
filth and ugliness. The countenance by nature was as hideous
as possible, being seamed with small-pox, while the nose
was of enormous size, flattened out to an immense width,
by the process which has given this tribe their distinctive
name among the hunters and trappers of the West.</p>

<p>There was the imprint of a villainous nature upon this
same countenance. It was stamped so clearly, that it could
be seen and read through all the dirt and grease that was
smeared over it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>As Little Rifle looked upon the Blackfoot, he felt also
that he was gazing upon the face of a murderer, one who
would bury his tomahawk into his brain with as little compunction
as if he were a wild animal.</p>

<p>The lad had concealed himself behind a rock, and held
his rifle cocked, aimed and at his shoulder, so that the body
of the red-skin was covered, and our hero had but to pull the
trigger to send the dark soul into eternity.</p>

<p>But he did not do so, for he would have felt that he too
committed a crime, in thus shooting down a human being
like a dog.</p>

<p>The Blackfoot, after stepping out of his boat, turned about
to draw it further up the bank, and, as he did so, he laid his
rifle upon the ground so as to permit him to use his arms
with greater facility.</p>

<p>This was the opportunity for which Little Rifle was waiting.
Taking one step from behind the rock, so as to bring
his body in full view, he called out:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ki! yi!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Like a flash of lightning, the red-skin turned so as to face
the sound, and doing so, saw the rifle not more than twenty
feet distant, pointed straight at his breast, and with the finger
resting upon the trigger. It was, indeed, only a hair&#8217;s breadth
between him and eternity.</p>

<p>Accustomed as was the savage to the most desperate emergencies,
he was completely taken off his guard by this unexpected
turn of events, and for a moment he stood like one
transfixed.</p>

<p>Then he began, almost imperceptibly, to lean his left side
over, preparatory to making a sudden snatch for his gun; but
Little Rifle was too thorough a scout to lose the advantage he
had gained by his superior wit.</p>

<p>He had learned considerable of the Blackfoot tongue from
old Ruff Robsart, and he now made the best use of it. Detecting
the purpose of the red-skin on the instant, he called
out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Stir a foot before I tell you, and I will shoot!&#8221;</p>

<p>Such a command was not to be mistaken, and the savage
straightened himself with a suddenness that made him appear
ridiculous. Men like him have too much dread of death to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
invite it by any direct means, and treacherous and vindictive
as he was, he comprehended his danger in all its fullness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, get,&#8221; added Little Rifle, still holding his piece at a
dead level, and closing one eye, as if to convince his enemy
that he was determined to make no mistake in the aim.</p>

<p>This peculiarly American expression, naturally enough, was
not very clear to the red-skin, who stood motionless and undecided
as to what was expected of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Move off; go away from the canoe!&#8221; said the boy, accompanying
the order by a swaying motion to the left, that
did not lessen his command of aim, and, at the same time,
made his meaning perfectly intelligible.</p>

<p>It went against the grain to obey the order, but there was
no question but that Little Rifle was master of the situation,
and he had the nerve to hold his vantage-ground. Noting
the hesitation of his captive, he made a shifting motion, as if
he had decided to fire. This was enough, and the Blackfoot,
with one sidelong bound, landed nearly a dozen feet to the
right of his canoe, and kept on walking, as if he had concluded
to leave such an uncongenial neighborhood altogether,
but our hero was not quite ready to give his permission.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; he commanded, in the same authoritative voice,
and the Blackfoot did hold on, wheeling about and staring at
his master, with an angry, defiant expression, which said, as
plainly as the words:</p>

<p>&#8220;What in thunder do you want now?&#8221;</p>

<p>Keeping his body covered by the muzzle of the deadly little
weapon, the boy now advanced a half-dozen steps, so as to
bring him far nearer to the canoe and rifle than was his
foe, then halted. Feeling himself undisputed master of the
field, he showed a boyish propensity to use his authority.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you on a walk, old chap? You look greasy and
dirty enough to slip along without any trouble. Now turn
your face to the Cascade Range, and travel. I&#8217;ve heard some
of your chiefs say that their home is in the setting sun, and
now you can go hunt for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>As there was no need of such extreme caution, now that
the Blackfoot was deprived of his weapon, Little Rifle lowered
his gun, and emphasized his words by appropriate gestures.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>&#8220;Your face is toward the sun, and now travel; keep it up
for a month or two. If you look back, I&#8217;ll pull the trigger
without waiting to give you a chance to sing your death-song.
<i>Go!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Not Weston himself could have surpassed the gait of the
red-skin, as he obeyed this peremptory order. Turning his
broad, flat face to the Cascade Range, he started off like a hen-pecked
husband, who suddenly discovers that it is a little past
the hour when he promised to be in the bosom of his family,
and he has good cause to dread the consequences of his forgetfulness.</p>

<p>Little Rifle stood smiling and amused, never once removing
his eyes from the dusky scamp, until he disappeared from
view in the wild, rocky ground that made the bank of the
river.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, as he has left, I will do the same,&#8221; concluded Little
Rifle, and placing his gun and that of the Indian in the canoe,
he shoved it into the water, sprung in and took the paddle.</p>

<p>And, as he did so, he proved himself as much at home as
when setting his beaver-traps and pursuing the game through
the fastnesses of Oregon.</p>

<p>Turning the head of the boat toward the other shore, he
sent it skimming over the swift current with as much speed
and skill as the Blackfoot Indian himself had displayed.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could only feel that he would keep on walking for a
week or two, I wouldn&#8217;t think any more about the red-skin,&#8221;
he mused, as he glanced back toward the shore he was leaving
so rapidly behind; &#8220;but I don&#8217;t think he will forgive me for
what I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the purpose of Little Rifle to throw the Indian entirely
off the scent, so that when he reached his cabin he could
rest and sleep in peace. The gathering darkness was in his
favor, as it made the task of giving him the slip so much the
easier.</p>

<p>When the lad was about the middle of the current, he
turned the prow down-stream, and the little boat sped like an
arrow, seeming to skim over, without touching, the surface,
resembling the sea-fowl in its flight.</p>

<p>Not doubting but that the Indian was on the watch, the boy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
had recourse to this simple stratagem to get rid of him. The
little river was very winding and rapid, and the canoe went
spinning around these curves with a bewildering velocity that
was enough to drive any red-skin mad who attempted to follow.</p>

<p>When this was done, and scarcely any twilight remained,
he shied the boat toward the other bank, at a point where a
solid rock offered firm footing. Springing nimbly out with
the two guns in his grasp, he kicked the boat out into the
stream again, and it went dancing onward like an egg-shell.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, if that red-skin wants to chase that canoe, he is
welcome to do so,&#8221; he muttered to himself, as he saw the tiny
vessel vanish from view in the gloom; &#8220;and if he finds out
that I have jumped ashore, let him hunt my trail.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with this satisfied conclusion, he turned about and deliberately
left the river behind. He felt that he had very
cleverly outwitted the Blackfoot Indian, and that he had
scarcely any occasion to give him further thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate, there is no need of holding him in mind between
now and sunrise,&#8221; he mentally added. &#8220;I have come
a good long tramp from the old cabin, and the moon will be
well up in the sky before I can make it. I only hope that
Uncle Ruff has got back from his hunt and is awaiting me
there, with a good steaming supper, over which we&#8217;ll forget
all about Indians.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ay, that were well, if the Indians would only forget all
about <i>them</i>!</p>

<span class="small">FLITTING SHADOWS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Rifle</span> struck off homeward, like one who feels that
he has little time at his disposal. After walking full a mile,
he struck another stream smaller than the first and which was
a tributary to the one he had just left. The banks were
made up principally of rocks and gravel, over which it was
very easy to pass, without leaving any trail behind. The lad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
made his way over these, with the care of a veteran hunter
and at length stepped down between two rocks, that towered
fully twenty feet from the ground. Between them was a
passage of about a rod in width, which gradually narrowed as
he advanced, until he was checked by what seemed an insuperable
obstruction; but this in reality was the cabin, the
&#8220;home,&#8221; toward which he had been journeying.</p>

<p>It was made with very little regard to &#8220;style;&#8221; the rocks
themselves afforded the rear, and two sides. The roof was
constructed by laying saplings and branches across the top
and covering them with leaves and twigs to such a depth that
they afforded an impervious protection against the inclemency
of the weather. The interior was divided into two apartments,
the partition being formed, mainly like the front, of
buffalo and bear-skins, firmly fastened to poles.</p>

<p>Thus a secure and comfortable retreat was afforded, no matter
how great the cold might be. Within were piles of the
richest and choicest furs, including those of the beaver, otter,
fox, marten, bear and buffalo. Some of these were exceedingly
valuable, being rich, glossy and of velvety softness; for
Old Robsart was as thorough a trapper as he was a hunter,
and he had a collection of peltries already secured, that, when
put in the market at San Francisco, would bring him a little
fortune in its way. The furs were all the best of their kind,
for he was too good a connoisseur to accept any of a second-rate
quality. Many a time, he took the beaver out of the trap,
examined him a moment, and then let him go in peace, until
he could get in better condition, by which time, also, the sagacious
animal was sure to be cute enough to keep clear of
all contrivances intended to entrap him, all of which Old Robsart
could not fail to know, but which did not affect his line
of conduct, as there were surely a thousand times more fur
bearing creatures in the North-west, than a regiment of trappers
like him could hope to capture.</p>

<p>No fire was ever kindled within this primitive home; for
these downy furs kept so much of the natural heat of the
body that the most cold-blooded need not be uncomfortable.
The fire needed for cooking purposes was always made somewhere
else.</p>

<p>Little Rifle&#8217;s anxiety now was to see whether his friend and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
patron was at home before him. Knowing that there was always
a possibility of some treacherous red-skin lying in wait,
in the cabin, he paused when some distance away, and gave
utterance to a sort of whistle that was always used as a signal
between him and his friend.</p>

<p>To his delight, this signal was instantly answered from
within the cabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is there!&#8221; he exclaimed, running forward, along the
gorge. &#8220;Hello, Uncle Ruff!&#8221;</p>

<p>The round full moon was shining from an unclouded sky,
so that objects were seen quite distinctly for a considerable
distance. As he spoke, the form of a man of goodly size,
with immense flowing beard, drew the buffalo-skin that answered
for a door aside, and stepped outside. His dress was
somewhat similar to that worn by the lad, except that instead
of his jaunty hat, he wore a close-fitting cap of fur. He was
a man of great strength and activity, and seemed to be in the
very prime of vigorous manhood, although evidently verging
on his sixty years.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, my little pet, you&#8217;re back again,&#8221; he said, as he
looked kindly down upon the lad, and reached out both his
hands to grasp his. &#8220;Hello! You&#8217;ve got two guns have you?
What does that mean? Have you been assassinating some
traveling gunsmith?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Uncle Ruff, I took that from a Blackfoot Indian.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Found him asleep, I s&#8217;pose, with that &#8217;ere piece hung up at
the head of his bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No I didn&#8217;t, either,&#8221; continued Little Rifle, parrying the
taunts of the grim old hunter, who always delighted in quizzing
him. &#8220;I took it away from a red-skin that was wide
awake as you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s it; I s&#8217;pose he&#8217;d been eating green persimmon
or tough babies, that give him the chollywobbles so as to
double him up with pain, and make him not care whether you
took his gun, or his head. Why didn&#8217;t you bring his scalp?
&#8217;Cause he wouldn&#8217;t let you, I s&#8217;pose. Let me take a look at
the gun and see whether it&#8217;s good for any thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>After turning it over very deliberately in his hands for several
minutes, trying the lock and seeing that it was loaded, he
pronounced it a &#8220;tollyble weapon.&#8221; And then, throwing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
aside his jesting words, he asked Little Rifle to give him the
particulars of his encounter with the red-skin, and listened
with great attention until he had finished.</p>

<p>&#8220;You behaved like a hero,&#8221; was the comment of old Robsart,
when he had finished, &#8220;and I think have fairly &#8217;arned
your supper. Ef you keep on improving at this rate, I&#8217;ll
make a hunter of you in the course of seventy-five or eighty,
or ninety or a hundred years. Come in to the banquet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little Rifle was as &#8220;hungry as a bear,&#8221; and he accepted the
invitation on the instant. Drawing the buffalo-robe aside, he
saw a tempting, luscious supper awaiting him upon a ledge of
rock, about a foot from the ground, on the center of which
sat a lamp, giving out quite a clear light from the oil that the
old hunter himself had extracted from some of the animals
he had captured in his traps. Without loss of time, the two
sat down, and began devouring the meal, chatting in the
meanwhile, like old friends who had not seen each other for
many days.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been on quite a tramp sence yesterday,&#8221; said Old
Ruff, with his cheeks swelling out with the juicy meat. &#8220;I
went a good many miles up the stream, and I used my eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you find the beavers any more plenty, than they are
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; ten thousand times, that is figgertively speakin&#8217;, as
the preachers down in the settlements say. Peltries is plenty,
but as is ginerally the case, the red-skins are as thick as grasshoppers,
and they kept me dodgin&#8217; round like a bull in fly
time. We&#8217;ve got to send down to Fr&#8217;isco, for a lot of lamps
to carry &#8217;round at night, so as to keep from tumbling over
&#8217;em, and when we ride our hosses toward the fort, we&#8217;ve
got to set a lamp on each ear to keep &#8217;em from stepping onto
&#8217;em. I think I mashed a dozen or two of &#8217;em, without knowing
it, &#8217;cause I mind me now that I stepped onto something,
two or three times, that felt kind of soft.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are strange creatures, Uncle Ruff, and I can&#8217;t understand
why they should hate the whites worse than they hate
the rattlesnake under their feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose &#8217;cause the whites feel just as lovely toward them.
You see it&#8217;s a squar&#8217; deal all round.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know but I can&#8217;t see any reason in it. There was that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
Blackfoot to-day. He must have seen me when I climbed
up on a high rock to take a look at the surrounding country,
and the very minute he saw me, that very minute he went to
work to get my scalp. They are a strange people.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scarred face of Old Ruff expanded into a quaint smile,
as he looked fondly down in the countenance of the lad, and
listened to his words. Then, laying the long, bony finger of
his right hand into the palm of his left, as if to call special
attention to his utterances, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, younker, you&#8217;re right. I&#8217;ve hunted wild animiles,
and fit Injins for a good many years, and I&#8217;ve come to the
conclusion that the red-skin is a qu&#8217;ar critter, and it takes a
good while afore a feller understands him. Some chaps come
out here fur a few weeks, and think they&#8217;ve got the hang of
things, when they don&#8217;t know no more about copper-skins,
than my grandmother does about tannin&#8217; grizzly b&#8217;ars. You
know they ginerally call the Injin red, but when he gits on
the war-path, he&#8217;s allers a &#8216;yeller.&#8217; They believe in spooks,
and when the spirit moves &#8217;em, they move the spirits. They
don&#8217;t like crooked paths, and generally take every thing
straight; they are very hospitable, and often treat their captives
to a hot stake. This is very touching, &#8217;specially to the
captive. They&#8217;re purty good shots, as you know yourself,
Little Rifle, &#8217;cause you&#8217;ve see&#8217;d &#8217;em shoot the rapids; they
are good on drawing a long bow, but often take an arrow
view of things, and I knowed an old chief once that lived
half the time upon arrow-root. Some younkers like you think
an Injin is the very beau ideal of a man, as they say down in
the settlements; but sence they&#8217;ve larned the use of guns,
they&#8217;ve hung up the fiddle and the bow, which must harrow
the feelin&#8217;s of the varmints a powerful heap. My nephew
that knows how to read books, calls him &#8216;Lo, the poor Injin,&#8217;
and I agree with him, for ef thar&#8217;s any lower critters in
all creation, I&#8217;ve never see&#8217;d &#8217;em. Sometimes you can tame
an Injin, and sometimes you can&#8217;t. They say an Injin never
forgits a kindness, and I s&#8217;pose they don&#8217;t, fur if you&#8217;re kind
to one of &#8217;em he&#8217;ll hunt you for a week, and never give up
till he gets a lock of your ha&#8217;r to remember you by. The
only trouble is that when he takes the lock he&#8217;s mighty sartin
to take all thar is on your head.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>&#8220;Then I suppose, Uncle Ruff, that the fellow I started off
on a walk won&#8217;t be likely to forget me very soon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much; and while you&#8217;re &#8217;bout it, you might jist as
well hold him in remembrance. You see, Little Rifle,&#8221; continued
Old Ruff, resuming his supper, &#8220;I never b&#8217;l&#8217;eve in
murder&mdash;not at all; but when you&#8217;ve got your gun p&#8217;inted
at a red-skin, and don&#8217;t feel like pulling the trigger, it&#8217;s a
good idee to shet your eyes, hold your gun steady, and sneeze.
When a man has his finger on the trigger, and onexpectedly
sneezes, the gun is purty sartin to go off. I found that out
when I was a little younker, and had a bow and arrer sighted
at my dear old grandmother, wondering how near I could
come to the end of her nose without hitting it, and not intendin&#8217;
to shoot at all. The old lady jist then had her snuffbox
out, and I s&#8217;pose some of it got into my norsetrils; fur
I fetched a sneeze that like to have blowed my nose off, and
when I got over the a&#8217;rthquake that had shook me to pieces,
I see&#8217;d my grandmother picking up the only three teeth that
she had left, from the floor. Afore I could ax her pardon,
the old man come in. I remember he had been digging in
the garden, and carried a spade in his hand. Wal,&#8221; added
the old joker, with a sigh, &#8220;I won&#8217;t describe the incidents
that follered; suffice it to say that I warn&#8217;t able to set down
for two weeks, and I don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose I&#8217;ll forgit that little episode
as long as I live.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps if I live all my life in these woods,&#8221; said Little
Rifle, in a voice of unconscious sadness, &#8220;I may come to look
upon life as you do; but I can not do so just yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t going to live here all your life,&#8221; said the hunter,
with such abruptness that the lad looked up inquiringly into
his face, as if he failed to get the full import of his words.
&#8220;You&#8217;re getting to be quite a likely-sized youngster, and it&#8217;s
time that you see&#8217;d something more of the world than you
can see in these parts, though a chap can see a powerful sight
when he looks toward the mountains. I&#8217;m going on East
arter the summer is over, and I&#8217;ll take you with me. You&#8217;ll
see sights then that I reckon will make you open your eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one sight which I often wonder whether I shall
ever be given to look upon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>&#8220;My parents&mdash;my brothers and sisters&mdash;if I have any, and
something seems to tell me that I have. I tell you, Uncle
Ruff, that strange dreams often come to me, not by night only,
but by daytime. Sometimes when I am gliding over the
stream in my canoe, or following the windings of the river,
I forget your caution about keeping my wits about me, and I
fall to thinking of the past, and of the future. I have done
it of late very frequently, and a feeling comes over me that I
can hardly describe. It has settled down into the belief that
something strange is going to happen&mdash;something which is to
change the whole course of my life, and make me really another
person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it going to be?&#8221; asked the old hunter, looking
at the lad, with a scared look, as if he dreaded to reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no more idea of its nature than have you, but I
know it&#8217;s coming, for all that. And then too,&#8221; he added,
with more animation, &#8220;by my trying so much to think of the
past. I have succeeded at last.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed the astonished hunter, moving away
from the table, &#8220;what can you call to mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember when you found me. I was lying asleep
upon some furs in an Indian lodge, when I opened my eyes,
and saw a man dressed in a hunter&#8217;s dress, leaning over me.
I remember that I was so frightened that I cried, and you took
me up in your arms to quiet me, and you carried me away
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it exactly,&#8221; replied the hunter; &#8220;and the qu&#8217;arest
thing about that business was that when I come to that
lodge, standing by itself, there wasn&#8217;t a red-skin to be seen
anywhar near. I walked in, picked you up, and walked
away ag&#8217;in, and never cotched so much as a glimpse of a
copper-skin. I went back arter a month or so to see if I
could l&#8217;arn any thing, and found the lodge burned to the
ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How far was that from here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hundreds of miles up along the Saskatchewan, on the
trapping-grounds of the Hudson Bay Company. You see
arter I got hold of you, I took such a fancy to you that I
was afeard some of the red-skins would make a hunt fur
you, so I emigrated, and come down into Oregon. Arter I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
got here, I felt troubled thinking maybe your parents or
friends might be up in them parts. So I left you with
some friends at Fort Abercrombie, and went up there to find
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And learned nothing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing at all; I spent a month in trampin&#8217; over the
grounds. You know that part of the country isn&#8217;t very
thick with white folks, and such as they be are hunters or
trappers. I went to the forts, and every place, where I
could find any of &#8217;em, but never a word did I l&#8217;arn. When
I fotched you away, I see&#8217;d that little rifle of yours hung
up over your head, and knowin&#8217; as it was meant for you,
I fotched that too. I expected to l&#8217;arn something from that,
&#8217;cause you know thar ar&#8217; two letters carved onto the stock&mdash;the
letters &#8216;<i>H. R.</i>&#8217;, and I s&#8217;posed by that means I&#8217;d git some
track of the owner&mdash;but it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t any use, and I give it up
at last. But what I want to ask my pet, is whether you
can&#8217;t call up any thing <i>afore</i> I come into the Injin lodge and
took you away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know how hard I&#8217;ve tried, and once or twice, it
seems to me that I have succeeded. It is a dim picture of
riding over a deep broad river, with a good many people in
the boat, and it seems to me that some of them were of my
own color, and I think, though you know that it is all guesswork,
that my father and mother were among them; but
the picture is so dim and faint that when I try to fix it in
my mind it slips away again, and all is dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you think of any thing else?&mdash;somethin&#8217; different
from that?&#8221; asked old Robsart, with the most intense interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing beyond that; all is blank. Of course, I remember
the several times that you left me at the fort, and
the kind men there, who taught me how to read and a
great many other things, but my memory is able to do no
more. Sometime it may succeed better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, I hope it will,&#8221; said Old Ruff, with a sigh; &#8220;it &#8217;ud go
hard with me to part with you, and I&#8217;d only do it fur your own
good; but these woods ain&#8217;t the place to fetch up a younker
like you. You&#8217;re smart &#8217;nough, and handsome &#8217;nough to desarve
better things. Old Ruff has got a little pile of money<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
stored away in one of the banks down in Fr&#8217;isco, and if your
friends don&#8217;t turn up, afore the summer&#8217;s over, we&#8217;ll see what
that can do fur you, my little pet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter what may happen in the future,&#8221; said Little
Rifle, in an affectionate tone, &#8220;no matter where the rest of
my life may be cast, or what good or evil fortune may befall
me, I can never forget <i>you</i>, who rescued me from the savages,
and have always been more than a father to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said the old hunter, hastily, and speaking
as if he were swallowing something that kept rising in
his throat, &#8220;that&#8217;s all right, and don&#8217;t say nothin&#8217; more about
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a long time they conversed in this familiar manner,
and then Little Rifle, as was always his practice, when with
the hunter, kissed him affectionately, bade him good-night,
and withdrew to his own apartment, which, it will be
remembered, was at the other end of the lodge or cabin,
where he was never disturbed or molested, during his sleeping
hours.</p>

<p>Old Robsart sat on the outside of his humble cabin for fully
two hours more, wrapped in deep thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Qua&#8217;r,&#8221; he muttered, after awhile, &#8220;but when I was
huntin&#8217; to-day, the same feelin&#8217; come over me. I know I&#8217;m
going to lose Little Rifle, in some way or other. It&#8217;ll go
hard with me&mdash;but I hope it will be for the best.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with this conclusion, he rose to his feet, passed into
the cabin and retired to slumber.</p>

<span class="small">THE VENGEFUL BLACKFOOT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A beautiful</span> spring morning dawned upon the Northwestern
solitudes, in which the two characters of whom we
have made mention had their home. Scarcely a cloud flecked
the sky, that looked like the deep, brilliant azure of Italy, and
the soft murmur of the distant waterfalls, and the songs of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
thousands of birds made the scene one of gladness and joy.
The day would have been warm and sultry but for the breeze
that came stealing down from the snowy peaks of the Cascade
Range, diffusing coolness through thousands of square miles
of adjoining territory.</p>

<p>By the time the sun was fairly above the horizon, old Robsart
and Little Rifle emerged from their humble quarters, and
moving down the narrow passage between the rocks, debouched
upon the shore of the stream which has already been mentioned.
Here a small canoe was found, into which both entered,
the old hunter taking the long ashen paddle in hand,
and sending the little vessel up the turbid current with as
much ease as if it were upon still water.</p>

<p>Few words passed between the two, for the communings
and dreams of the previous evening were still with them. The
appearance of Little Rifle was of one who had slept very little
during the night, and the old hunter, understanding the cause
of his reverie, forbore to intrude upon it.</p>

<p>This excursion was to visit their traps, their practice being
always to do so before partaking of breakfast.</p>

<p>Several hundred yards&#8217; steady pull, and the boat came to a
rest against the grassy beach, and old Ruff stepped out, drawing
the prow of the boat up after him. As he did so, the
boy made a motion as if to follow him, seeing which he waved
him back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay whar you be, Little Rifle, for I won&#8217;t be gone
long.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused and looked up questioningly in his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want me to help you, Uncle Ruff?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to have you along, but I guess you&#8217;d better stay
thar. You know thar be only three traps fur me to visit.
When we halt further up, thar&#8217;ll be a half-dozen and you can
help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; replied the lad, settling back in the stern of
the canoe, ready and willing to wait.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be better to leave the younker alone, at any rate,
till I come back,&#8221; muttered the trapper, as he strode away.
&#8220;Thar ain&#8217;t many o&#8217; the varmints in these parts, and the way
he got along yesterday shows that he knows how to take care
of himself. Let him think, let him dream, and mebbe he&#8217;ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
be able to work out the mystery that I can&#8217;t see head nor tail
to. Thar&#8217;s a good deal in that handsome head of his&#8217;n, and
he&#8217;ll pitch it out arter awhile.&#8221;</p>

<p>Left to himself, the boy reclined in an easy position, with
his head lying back upon the stern of the canoe, and his eyes
looking directly upward at the sky, across which a few white
feathery specks of clouds were now beginning to drift. The
soft ripple of the stream, as it washed against the bank and
around the little boat, the faint murmur of the forest, and,
above all, the thoughts that had haunted him since the talk
with the old hunter&mdash;all these conspired to throw a languid,
dreamy spell over the lad, such as sometimes comes over one,
when only partially awake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle Ruff tells me that he is going to remove me from
this place, before winter comes again, and I can not tell whether
his promise gives me most pleasure or pain. I feel that
I ought to leave here, for my own nature tells me that this is
not the way in which my Creator intends that I shall live.
What I have learned at the forts, and what he has told me,
has given me some idea of the great world which moves
around me; but I shrink back from stepping into it. It must
be that while this sort of life gives one a certain kind of courage,
it also makes him a coward. I could meet the deadly
Blackfoot with more courage than I could step into the streets
of that wonderful city of San Francisco&mdash;that old Robsart calls
Fr&#8217;isco. And yet, I suppose I would become accustomed to
that, too, in time. If my dream of last night comes true, a
change will come very soon. I mustn&#8217;t forget to keep my
wits about me,&#8221; he added, with a sudden start, as if he were
going to make amends for his temporary forgetfulness.</p>

<p>Looking at the opposite bank, up and down stream, and off
in the direction taken by the old hunter, he saw and heard
nothing suspicious. All was as still and undisturbed as if this
solitude had never been trod by the foot of man or animal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess every thing is all right,&#8221; he concluded, as he lay
back again, and gave way to the fascinating reverie that was
continually stealing upon him.</p>

<p>And, lost in these weird dreamings&mdash;these vague imaginings,
Little Rifle became utterly oblivious to what was going on
around him. He forgot that he was reclining in an Indian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
canoe, with no one standing sentinel over him; the lessons of
the old trapper were lost upon him, and his mind was almost
in the condition of the opium-taker, who really dwells apart
in a world of his own.</p>

<p>And as he reclined thus, with his vacant gaze fixed upon
the blue sky above, the undergrowth along the bank, scarcely
a rod below him, noiselessly parted, and a figure came to
view.</p>

<p>It was the Blackfoot Indian of the day before, whom the
lad had conquered and dispossessed of his rifle. He had no
gun as yet, but the muscles of the bare right arm were ridged
from the pressure of his fingers around the handle of the
gleaming tomahawk. The hideous face glowed with the white
heat of exultant passion, as he looked upon the lad and realized
how completely the tables were turned.</p>

<p>Standing for a moment, with his head craned forward, as
if to make certain that he fully comprehended the situation,
he began advancing, with the stealthy, silent tread of the cat
upon the beautiful bird, never once removing his glittering
eyes from his victim.</p>

<p>A dozen feet away, he paused. He stood on the very spot
he desired, and from which he could drive the keen-edged
tomahawk crashing through the skull of the unconscious lad.</p>

<p>Little Rifle still lay in the same dreamy reverie, his hat having
fallen from his head, and the short, curly auburn hair resting
on the gunwale, while his clear rose-tinted cheek looked
more handsome and attractive than ever.</p>

<p>Can no hand be outstretched to save him? Uncle Ruff is
still a half-mile away, attending to his traps, and his arm is
powerless to prevent the dreadful tragedy. Who, then, shall
interfere?</p>

<p>The Blackfoot is not the one to wait. Slowly he draws
back the hand that grasps the tomahawk, and with his eyes
fixed upon the marble-like forehead, aims directly at the brain
of the dreaming boy!</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.<br />


<span class="small">THE MYSTERIOUS SHOT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Blackfoot paused only long enough to make sure of
his aim, when he concentrated all his mighty strength in his
terrible right arm and hurled his tomahawk with a tremendous
force, that would have cloven through the birchen sides
of the canoe, and the skull of the boy like so much pasteboard,
had the glittering weapon sped true to its aim.</p>

<p>But it went fully a dozen feet over his head, whizzing far
out into the stream, into which it fell with a loud splash.</p>

<p>And the reason for this was that at the very instant he
threw his power into his single arm, there was a sharp crack
from the wood, and a bullet went crashing through his brain.
With a howl and spasmodic clutching of his limbs, he staggered
forward and fell upon his face, dead.</p>

<p>It was a frightful awakening from Little Rifle&#8217;s reverie,
and he leaped out of the canoe, landing several feet away
upon the shore, with the belief that he himself was mortally
wounded. Staring wildly around, he saw the body of the
dead savage, and the second glance identified it as the one
who had hunted him the day before, and who had been so
cleverly outgeneraled.</p>

<p>Walking toward him, the boy saw in what manner he had
been slain, and then he understood what it all meant. This
treacherous red-skin had attempted to steal upon and kill
him, when the saving bullet had averted the fatal blow.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is fortunate that I had Uncle Ruff so near at hand,&#8221;
he concluded, with a feeling of heartfelt gratitude, as he
looked about in quest of his friend. &#8220;Another moment and
it would have been the end of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little danger of his again falling into the slumber from
which he had been so rudely awakened. Holding his rifle in
hand, he looked about, ready for the coming of white or red-men;
but to his surprise, he saw neither.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know why Uncle Ruff persists in remaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
away so long,&#8221; he mused, after he had waited some time in
this manner; but, fifteen minutes more passed, when the familiar
form of the old trapper debouched from the wood, bearing
upon his shoulder the skins of three beavers, which he had
taken from his traps. To each was appended the tail, which
forms one of the choicest titbits of the hunters of the North-west.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I hear a gun?&#8221; asked old Robsart, the moment he
came within speaking distance. &#8220;It sounded down in these
parts and&mdash;hello! you fotched the old chap at last did you?&#8221;
he exclaimed, abruptly pausing and staring at the inanimate
form of the Blackfoot.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the same red-skin that I told you about last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I reckoned, the minute I looked on him. Don&#8217;t it
prove what I said? That &#8217;ere chap has been huntin&#8217; &#8217;round
arter you ever since you started him toward the setting sun.
He&#8217;s like a wolf, that you think you&#8217;ve got off your trail,
when he starts up ag&#8217;in arter you&#8217;ve forgot all about him.
He&#8217;s hunted night and day for you, and arter he&#8217;s sot eye on
you has watched and waited for his chance; but he didn&#8217;t
make out any thing by the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; his career has ended to a certainty. That was a
most fortunate shot of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What yer talking &#8217;bout?&#8221; demanded the trapper, staring
savagely at him. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I mean that rifle-shot of yours that killed the Blackfoot,
just in time to save me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me! hain&#8217;t I just got back from visiting the traps, and
hain&#8217;t pulled trigger this mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was now the turn of Little Rifle to be amazed, and the
questions and answers that immediately followed revealed the
fact that the bullet that stretched the Blackfoot low had not
been fired by the old trapper, nor could he or the boy tell
from whose friendly gun it came.</p>

<p>This added a new element of interest to the situation. The
old trapper went to the prostrate body, and after examining
the wound, and knowing the posture of the red-skin when
about to throw his tomahawk, he declared that the ball had
come from the other side the stream at a point almost opposite
where they stood.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>&#8220;And let us see if we kin find out who done it,&#8221; he exclaimed,
flinging the peltries into the canoe; &#8220;jump in and
we&#8217;ll paddle over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Only a few seconds were needed to carry them to the other
shore, where they made a minute search for their friend, frequently
calling out; but they neither saw nor could they find
any traces of his presence there.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lucky spot, anyway,&#8221; said the old man, &#8220;so we&#8217;ll
start a fire, and have our breakfast afore we go any further.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fire was started in a few minutes and breakfast made
of the beaver tails to which we have alluded. The startling
incident afforded them abundant material for conversation,
and for the time drove all thoughts of the more important
subject from their minds.</p>

<p>But, when the meal was concluded, Old Ruff said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Little Rifle, I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to make the round of the
traps, and will fotch in all the furs and peltries thar&#8217;s to bring.
It&#8217;s gettin&#8217; so close to hot weather, that purty soon the skins
won&#8217;t be worth the gatherin&#8217;. I think we&#8217;ll make a move
further up-stream to-morrer, fur all the varmints are so thick
thar, and we&#8217;ll snatch all that we kin. You see, this yer
Blackfoot poking round in these parts makes it look as though
some more of &#8217;em mought be here and thar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you know that this one made special search for me,
and no doubt is the only one that has ventured so far as
this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely, my boy; but you mus&#8217;n&#8217;t forgit that when you
first cotched sight of him, he was coming down the river, as
though he war looking fur you then. What I want to git at
is to find out whether any of the varmints are very close.
You kin go round by the falls, and make a good search. Take
the day fur it, if you need so much time, but make it sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; replied the lad, springing to his feet. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
try and be back by night, but, if I don&#8217;t you&#8217;ll understand the
reason why.&#8221;</p>

<p>And humming a merry tune, the boy struck off into the
wood, and almost instantly vanished from view.</p>

<p>Young, strong and in perfect health it was scarcely possible
that he should not be in the best of spirits. There is
something in the clear, brilliant, pure air of the Far West and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
North-west, that penetrates a man&#8217;s system like the electric
current.</p>

<p>Added to this was that strange, vague, fluttering hope that
had risen in his breast, and which as yet he could scarcely
comprehend, but with the passing of every hour, the conviction
grew upon him that he was upon the eve of a great crisis
in his life history. It was a verification of the old legend
that &#8220;Coming events cast their shadows before.&#8221;</p>

<p>The day was as beautifully clear as the preceding one, and
the lad moved through the solitude, with an elastic step, that
proved that there was no unwillingness upon his part to assume
this task, which it may be supposed was attended with
no inconsiderable danger.</p>

<p>&#8220;How strangely I was rescued,&#8221; he muttered, as he walked
along. &#8220;Heaven sent my unknown friend at the very
moment; had he delayed his coming a moment longer, I
should not have been here. Uncle Ruff is pretty shrewd, but
he can not imagine who the man was, except he thinks in a
general way that it was some hunter who has happened to
stroll down this way; but there is something which he don&#8217;t
understand in the way he takes himself off after firing his
gun, without waiting for so much as a word of thanks from
us. I am glad that Uncle Ruff has sent me off on this
scout, for it seems as if I were going toward my friend, with
a good chance of meeting.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dense woods through which the boy had been making
his way thus far, now assumed a different character&mdash;being
much more open and broken, while the ground was rocky
and hilly&mdash;the face of the country being such as is found in
a place where the rivers and streams can only make their
way by passing through deep gorges and kenyons.</p>

<p>Pressing forward in this manner, Little Rifle at last found
himself upon quite a lofty ridge, which gave him an extensive
view in every direction. It was indeed the post of observation,
whither he had directed his steps from the first.</p>

<p>With characteristic caution, he screened himself from observation
as much as possible by climbing to the top of one
of the scrubby oaks, and then making a long and careful
survey of the suspicious territory.</p>

<p>Only a single hasty glance was cast back over the region<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
from which he had just come, as that was under the guardianship
of old Robsart, who needed no assistance from him,
in a work of that kind.</p>

<p>But he looked to the westward, where hundreds of miles
of the vast solitude opened before him. It was a scene
made up of rock, stream and wood in all their varied beauty,
such as would have won the eye, in a loving dream, of
any painter.</p>

<p>Here and there he could trace the winding course of the
streams, starting on their long journey to the far-away Mexican
Gulf. In many cases these streams would be visible
for the better part of a mile, and then would be hidden from
view by the rocks and woods that interposed&mdash;only for a
time, however, as they soon shot into sight again, white with
bubbles and foam, into which they had been beaten on their
furious, plunging way through the gorges. In two places
these torrents disappeared into deep, narrow kenyons, above
which hung a mist, that threw back a faint prismatic reflection
in the bright morning sunlight.</p>

<p>And so the vision extended, the streams diminishing to
tiny silver threads, the woods and rocks melting into a dim,
smoky haze, until far away toward the magnificent snow-crowned
Cascade Range, which to the imaginative boy seemed
the wall that shut him in from the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beyond that lies my future,&#8221; he muttered, giving utterance
to his romantic imaginings; &#8220;when shall some one come
to lead me through that gate? Must it be Old Ruff himself
who is to start me upon that road, of whose end I can not
dream? Away up yonder, on the slope of that mountain-chain,
nestles the little fort, that was built many long years
ago by the Hudson Bay Company, and there I have spent
much of my time, receiving instruction from the kind-hearted
men there. I wonder whether any of them ever suspected&mdash;&#8217;sh!&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused suddenly, and placed his finger to his lips, as
if to shut back from his own ears the words he came so
near uttering. With a deep flush upon his handsome face,
he glanced furtively around, as though affrighted, lest the
wind should have carried it to some ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must be careful,&#8221; he added, in a whisper, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
same startled look; &#8220;they say that trees and rocks have
ears. No one knows <i>that</i> secret but old Robsart, and he
would sooner be shot and scalped than reveal it. I can not
see the fort,&#8221; he continued, looking so far as his vision would
permit over the vast area of country that intervened, &#8220;but
I could make my way to it in the night time. Yonder is
the river that I am to reconnoiter, and yonder are the falls,
where Old Ruff suspects are Indians&mdash;and yonder are the Indians,
too!&#8221;</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.<br />


<span class="small">THE STRANGE CANOE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Rifle</span> uttered this exclamation in the voice of one
who is certain of what he says, as well he might be; for, as
he fixed his eyes upon the swiftly-flowing stream, as it swept
onward toward the thunderous falls, his vision also roved
along the bank toward its source, far up in the mountains.</p>

<p>The stream was a little less than a mile from where he
stood, and quite a distance above the falls alluded to, were
visible three Indian lodges. They stood upon an open piece
of land, immediately back of which were rocks and ravines,
and were close to the edge of the river, flowing by their very
base. They were of the usual character, made of barks and
skins, supported upon poles that were stacked like muskets,
the lower ends being a dozen feet apart, while they interlocked
at the top, where an open space was left.</p>

<p>From the top of one of these lodges issued a thin, shadowy
column of smoke, so faint and vapory that it could only be
seen when the eye was directed fairly toward it.</p>

<p>This was the only evidence or sign of life that met the gaze
of the boy, and it seemed rather to add to the loneliness of
the immense solitude spread out before his eyes. The smoke
showed that there was some one, out of sight, in <i>one</i> of the
lodges, at least; but in the distance, the river had a solemn,
quiet flow, and the roar of the waterfall below, mellowed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
subdued by the distance, was in perfect keeping with the
scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there are the Indians,&#8221; he added, as, perched in the
tree, he gazed long and searchingly on the scene; &#8220;they are
there, though my eye can not see them, for those <i>signs</i> are too
plain for any one to mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reasoning upon his knowledge of red-men, he concluded
that one of those marauding bands of Blackfeet, that are still
encountered in the Far West, had halted here for a few days
to engage in hunting, and most probably in salmon-fishing;
for, as is well known, the Columbia and its tributaries abound
with this fish, which is eagerly sought by both white and red
men.</p>

<p>The danger to be feared was, that these Indians, hunting
and fishing in the vicinity, would discover signs of the proximity
of the two trappers and hunters, and, to use a common
expression, would &#8220;go for them.&#8221; As bad luck would have
it, also, they were directly between the present trapping-grounds
of Old Ruff and Little Rifle, and those to which they
had concluded to move their traps. Consequently, they would
be pretty certain to encounter &#8220;Indian&#8221; in uncomfortable profusion,
wheresoever they might choose to locate.</p>

<p>The lad, from his perch in the top of the oak, looked down
upon the scene for fully a half-hour, in the expectation of
seeing some movement upon the part of the Blackfeet. All
that time the thin, light-colored smoke crept up through the
funnel-like opening, but not a solitary red-skin showed himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be that they are off on a hunt,&#8221; concluded Little
Rifle, as his patience at last gave out; &#8220;and if they have left
their squaws behind, they are asleep. Anyway, I must learn
more about them.&#8221;</p>

<p>And acting upon this resolve, he descended the tree and
struck off in a direct line toward the river. He knew well
enough that if he should return to the old hunter with no
more knowledge than he now possessed, he would be chided
for performing only a part of his duty, his maxim being that
a reconnoissance that was incomplete was worse than none at
all, as it created all manner of doubt and distrust, without suggesting
the remedy. The intervening distance was traversed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
without difficulty, Little Rifle not forgetting to exercise great
care in his movements, as always became a person in the presence
of danger.</p>

<p>The point where he struck the stream was without any
wood at all, but was lined with broken, jagged and irregular
rocks, among which he managed to pick his way without exposing
himself to any suspicious eye that might be on the
alert upon the opposite side.</p>

<p>He had kept his bearings so well that he found himself directly
opposite the three lodges, which were thus scarcely a
hundred yards distant, and in the best view he could possibly
desire.</p>

<p>&#8220;They must be a sleepy set over there,&#8221; he concluded, as
he ensconced himself in a position to keep ward and watch;
&#8220;that is, if any one is there, for I don&#8217;t think a soul has stirred
outside since I first saw them. Hello!&#8221;</p>

<p>His curiosity was suddenly and unexpectedly gratified, although,
as it speedily proved, in a way that was not entirely
satisfactory.</p>

<p>A single Blackfoot Indian, that looked like the twin brother
of the one who had met his doom a few hours before,
walked out of the lodge from which the smoke was issuing,
stretched and yawned, and walking to the edge of the stream,
looked up and down for a moment, as though expecting some
one or something, and then deliberately walked back again,
and disappeared from view.</p>

<p>&#8220;That looks as if he had come out to wash his face, and
had become disgusted,&#8221; laughed Little Rifle. &#8220;I think a good
scrubbing would be sure to kill him. I suppose, now, he will
go to sleep for the rest of the day.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the essentials of a good scout, both in civilized and
savage warfare, is a patience that can bear the test of hours.
The Esquimaux, who sits by the air-hole in the ice without
stirring a muscle, even if the seal does not thrust out his nose,
is the beau ideal of a patient scout, although he is too much
of a porpoise himself to get impatient.</p>

<p>Young as was Little Rifle, he was the possessor of this
quality, and had displayed it to a remarkable degree on more
than one occasion; but it will be remembered that the circumstances
were exceptional to-day, and he was in that feverish,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
uneasy condition of mind which at times made him, as it
were, another person.</p>

<p>At any other time he would have centered his attention on
the three lodges across the stream, and kept it there until the
sun went down, despite hunger, cold and discomfort; but he
could not do so now. It required such an effort upon his
part to withdraw his mind from that tempting reverie, or day-dreaming,
which had so nearly proved his death, that he was
dissatisfied, and felt that he must be moving, and that he must
do something or the burden would become unbearable.</p>

<p>What precise form this relief would have taken, it is hard
to conjecture, but most probably the lad would have ventured
to cross the stream at a point further up, so as to get still
nearer the lodges; but this perilous proceeding was happily
prevented by a most unlooked-for diversion.</p>

<p>While keeping his attention, as a general thing, fixed upon
the most suspicious part of his view, he remembered that some
of the owners of these lodges were away, and there was no
telling by what route they might return. So he bestowed an
occasional glance up and down stream, not forgetting that he
might be lying in their very path.</p>

<p>It was something like fifteen minutes after the disappearance
of the Blackfoot, when Little Rifle chanced to look up-stream,
and saw a small Indian canoe suddenly shoot to view.</p>

<p>There was nothing particularly striking in this, but there
was something extraordinary in what he discovered the next
moment. A single person was holding the guiding-paddle,
and instead of being a Blackfoot Indian, as he had expected,
it proved to be a white boy, apparently his own age, or but
slightly older.</p>

<p>He gave but little motion to the oar, as the current was
rapid enough to make it unnecessary, and his principal occupation
was in guiding the frail bark.</p>

<p>The appearance of this stranger, as may well be supposed,
filled Little Rifle with the most profound amazement, as it
was the first time in all his life that he had seen a boy in this
section of the country, and coming to view so near to where
the Indians were, caused no little inquiry and speculation as
to what it all meant.</p>

<p>He supposed of course that the lad was on good terms with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
the Indians, else he would not have shown himself so near
them; but this belief was speedily dispelled by the actions of
the lad himself.</p>

<p>While yet some distance up-stream, he suddenly caught
sight of the lodges, and instantly showed the greatest consternation&mdash;seizing
the paddle, and dipping it deep into the water,
as he made furious efforts to cause it to ascend the stream
again, as though he hoped to pass out of sight around the
curve above.</p>

<p>But he was utterly unable to overcome the current, and
only succeeded in slightly checking his speed, the manner in
which he handled the paddle showing that he was quite a
novice, with a skill that could not compare with that of Little
Rifle.</p>

<p>When the boat had drifted down to a point nearly opposite
the lodges, its inmate seemed to discover that he was wasting
his strength, and he turned about again so as to face the
dwelling-places of the dreaded red-skins.</p>

<p>Not one of them showed his face, and the boy pausing a
moment to regain breath, headed the canoe directly toward
the point where the excited Little Rifle was watching his
actions; but this seemed to give no more satisfaction than the
other course, for in case he succeeded, it would compel him
to land directly opposite the lodges, where the chances of his
being seen would be doubly increased.</p>

<p>As the best thing that could be done, he resorted to a
rather curious artifice. One hurried glance toward the Blackfoot
dwellings showed him that he still remained undiscovered,
whereupon he instantly lay flat down, so that he could not be
seen by any one upon the bank, and in this posture he let the
canoe go, trusting to good fortune to carry him by in safety.</p>

<p>Little Rifle was on the point of calling to him, and volunteering
his assistance, when he concluded that his voice would
be pretty certain to attract the attention of the keen-eared
savages in the lodges, and thus endanger the safety of both.
Accordingly he remained quiet.</p>

<p>There is something in solitude that attracts one human
heart to another, and when Little Rifle saw the canoe gliding
by, he determined to learn something of its occupant. He
reasoned that he was not likely to be alone in this wilderness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
and that strange, dim, vague feeling came over him, that
caused the expression of his thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be that <i>he</i> is the one sent by Heaven to lead me
through the gate that now shuts out the great wide world. I
will yield to the impulse that leads me toward him.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, at the same time a shy, bashful emotion restrained
him from moving away at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will wait and see whether he is fortunate enough to get
beyond sight of the lodges without discovery.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he again crouched down behind the rocks, and with
an anxiously beating heart waited to see what the result of
this perilous mishap was to be.</p>

<p>The strange canoe had something like a half-mile to pass,
before a curve in the river would shut it from view of any
one who stood upon the shore, where the Blackfoot had
shown himself. The probability was that the boy, after getting
fairly below the lodges, would work his boat in to shore,
so as to get out of the dangerous range as speedily as possible.</p>

<p>The little boat kept in the middle of the current, the occupant
persistently remaining out of sight, and Little Rifle, after
watching it for a few moments, would look directly across the
stream, dreading to see the painted Blackfoot issue forth, and
repent his survey.</p>

<p>Further and further drifted the little boat, until it looked
like a duck floating at will upon the water. But, if the Indian
sees it, he will recognize it on the instant, and then there
will be trouble. The lad does not intend to land, and must
remain in view for some time longer.</p>

<p>The minutes dragged slowly by, and it appeared as if the
tiny vessel remained absolutely stationary upon the surface of
the water, although Little Rifle knew that it was still going
forward rapidly. At the distance, he could not identify the
lad, even if his head was above the gunwale, and our hero
was beginning to wonder what his conduct could mean, when
he observed that the canoe was gradually edging to one side,
as if it were creeping in toward the land.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is not,&#8221; he added, as he carefully scrutinized it, &#8220;it
is passing around the bend in the river, and will now be lost
to view in a few minutes, and then all danger will be over&mdash;Heaven
save him!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.<br />


<span class="small">A FEARFUL ADVENTURE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> this moment, Little Rifle chanced to look across the
stream, and instead of one Blackfoot, he saw two come forth
from the middle lodge, and sauntering to the edge of the river,
pause, and, while gesticulating and conversing earnestly, they
first looked up the current, and then down again.</p>

<p>&#8220;They will see the canoe! they will discover the lad and
he will be lost!&#8221; was the agonized thought of the little fellow,
who, turning his gaze in the same direction, just managed to
descry the boat, as it glided out of sight around the bend in
the river.</p>

<p>The Blackfeet indeed acted as if they had discovered something
suspicious; for one of them pointed down-stream, and
the other following the direction indicated, seemed to be gazing
intently as though his keen vision had detected the same
thing.</p>

<p>Little Rifle could plainly hear their guttural voices, as they
spoke in louder and more excited tones, but he was unable to
catch or comprehend a word they uttered. Fortunately they
remained in view but a few minutes, when they turned about
and strode into their lodge at a much more rapid gait than
they had employed in leaving.</p>

<p>The watcher behind the rocks was determined to wait no
longer. Extricating himself as carefully and hastily as possible
from his station, he placed himself so far away from the
stream, that he felt secure from observation in case the Blackfeet
should come forth again, and then he hurried down the
river with all the speed of which he was capable.</p>

<p>Sinewy and active as was the boy, he made rapid progress,
and shortly after came back to the margin opposite the point
where he had last seen the canoe, and, as he did so, a sudden
terror almost took the breath from his body.</p>

<p>For directly below this bend were the falls of which we
have made mention, and of which he would not have thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
again, even at this moment, but for the overwhelming roar
that broke upon his ear, as he emerged from the forest, where
the sound met with no obstruction.</p>

<p>He cast one hurried glance down the stream, and gracious
Heaven! what did he see?</p>

<p>There was the canoe, still near the center of the stream,
and within a hundred yards of the falls, toward which it was
rushing with the speed of a race-horse.</p>

<p>But the occupant was no longer asleep or insensible to
the frightful peril of his position. He had evidently awakened
to a sense of his dreadful danger, the instant he had
passed around the bend in the river, which not only gave
the rush and whirl a terrible power, but showed him the
surging current, and the mist rising from the churning foam
below.</p>

<p>From one danger into a greater, he had striven with the
desperation of despair to bring the canoe out of its plunge
into destruction; but had either broken his paddle or had
lost it; for he was now using his rifle, as a substitute, grasping
the barrel and driving the stock through the water, with
a fierce rapidity, that proved that he understood that his life
depended upon his success.</p>

<p>That one terrified look showed Little Rifle that it was
beyond the power of the poor lad to accomplish the task,
and that he was only insuring his destruction by continuing
the effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;Throw your gun down! jump overboard, and swim for
land! It is your only hope!&#8221;</p>

<p>These words were shouted by our hero, who swung his
hat aloft and screeched like a madman. It may be that his
clear, musical voice possessed such a penetrating power, that
they reached the ear of his strange friend in his extremity;
for he ceased his frantic efforts, and turned his white, imploring
face toward him, as if to thank him for the warning
even though it could aid him naught.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jump! jump! I tell you!&#8221; called out Little Rifle, rushing
into the water to his knees, in his extreme solicitude,
&#8220;throw your gun aside, and you can do it. Wait a dozen
seconds more and you are lost!&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy did wait the dozen seconds. He must have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
understood the words that were shouted to him, for he sat
back in the stern of the canoe, folded his arms, and looking
intently at Little Rifle, sadly shook his head, and then raising
his hand waved it in greeting toward him.</p>

<p>And as he did so, he could not have spoken more plainly,
had he used the word.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand your advice; but it is too late! I must
go over the falls to my death, and good-by!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a strange and impressive sight to see this mere boy,
after fighting so bravely against fate, meet his doom with the
stoicism of an Indian war-chief. There was no wailing or
outcry, no frenzied flinging of himself in the boat, as it might
be expected that such a one would do, when he saw himself
gliding so swiftly and irresistibly toward death; but he sat
back in the position we have described, and after his salutation
to Little Rifle, turned his face away, and looked at the
waterfall before him.</p>

<p>The action of the doomed lad awed and thrilled the
heart of Little Rifle, who felt that it was no ordinary character
that he saw before him; for not one boy in a thousand
could meet death with such heroism. For one instant, the
agonized watcher closed his eyes to shut out the dreadful
sight, and then yielding to an overmastering attraction, he
leaped back out of the water, and dashed at headlong speed,
down the bank, over rocks and through undergrowth, until
he reached a point directly below the falls, from which he
could look up and see the vast sheet of water, as it poured
over the ledge into the seething, furious hell of foam and
froth below. Here he paused and gazed upward.</p>

<p>The river just before making its final plunge was compressed
into a kenyon-like passage not more than one-half
its width a hundred yards further up. This deepened and
gave it far greater velocity, the current shooting forward
like a mill-race, the surface being covered with little eddying
waves, as if they were sensible of the awful caldron into
which they were so soon to make their boiling plunge.
But the entire volume, sweeping forward with an indescribable
grandeur and majesty, moved over the ledge in a solid, compact
body, fully a dozen feet in depth and without a break.
Descending perhaps a rod, in the same solid volume of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
deep green color, it could be seen the outer surface of this
mass began to assume, here and there, a white, feathery appearance,
which rapidly increased, until, something less
than a hundred feet below, it resembled an Alpine avalanche&mdash;all
of a glistening, snowy white. Here where the water
was arrested, there was a perfect pandemonium; the billows
turning and rolling over each other, throwing the blinding
spray far up on both banks, while a thousand currents and
counter-currents struggled and fought with each other with
such desperate fierceness, that it was not until the stream had
reached a point several hundred yards away, and had expanded
into its usual breadth, that it assumed any thing like
its natural appearance.</p>

<p>The din that filled the ears of Little Rifle, as he stood on
a flat, projecting slab of rock, where his clothing was speedily
saturated, was enough to drive an ordinary person frantic,
although it scarcely affected one who had spent such a portion
of his life in the wilderness as had he.</p>

<p>But here he might have shouted his voice away, and not
the slightest sound would have been heard even by himself.
He could do nothing but stand and watch and wait, with
that freezing terror all through his nerves that made him
feel as if he must forever remain rooted to the spot.</p>

<p>&#8220;But where is the canoe?&#8221; he thought, when it seemed
to him that he had been waiting an interminable period,
while, from the very nature of the case, he had been there
only a few seconds. &#8220;Could it have gone over while I was
making my way to the spot? No, that can not be, for I almost
flew. Oh! is there no hand to save him?&#8221;</p>

<p>At that instant Little Rifle caught sight of the canoe, as it
glided swiftly out to view, seeming to poise itself for a moment
in mid-air, like an eagle balancing himself for his earthward
sweep, and then the boat, with its brave occupant, shot
downward, with a velocity that seemed almost to baffle the
eye.</p>

<p>It appeared as if the water as it swept over the ledge
of rocks was of unusual density, for the canoe rested on the
surface, like a feather, as though it had lost all weight.</p>

<p>Little Rifle saw the prow, following the curve of the river,
turn downward, so that it stood perfectly perpendicular, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
white-faced but resolute lad who occupied it grasping the
sides with his hands so as to maintain his place.</p>

<p>In this way it made the descent, for, perhaps, fifty feet,
when the stern, probably retaining the momentum longer
than the lighter bow, advanced so much further that the canoe
turned a complete sommersault, both it and the boy shooting
from view in the roaring, plunging and churning hell of
waters at the bottom of the falls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lost! lost! gone to his last account!&#8221; gasped Little
Rifle, recovering from the paralysis in which he stood up to
this instant. &#8220;He showed that he was a brave lad, and he
deserved a better fate&mdash; There! can it be?&#8221;</p>

<p>Although, as we have shown, the efforts of the poor boy to
work his canoe in to shore and out of the frightful current
failed, yet it resulted, despite the appearance to the contrary,
in getting quite a distance toward the bank whereon Little
Rifle stood, and he noted the fact, with some surprise, as it
came over the falls.</p>

<p>As he stood on the wet rock, looking at the foaming abyss
before him, something dark shot up to view almost at his
feet. Looking downward, he had just time to see that it was
a part of the canoe&mdash;about a half&mdash;when it drove out of
sight again, in the resistless grasp of the current.</p>

<p>And the same glance that showed him this, showed also
the face of the boy who had made the fearful plunge, only
for an instant, like his view of the canoe. The face, white
and motionless, rose from the water, and then sunk out of
view, as it sped down the current, with scarcely less speed
than the river possessed directly above the falls themselves.</p>

<p>That one look was sufficient for Little Rifle. A sudden
hope came to his heart that the lad might still have the breath
of life in his body, and placing his gun upon the rock at his
feet, he concentrated all his strength and made a leap directly
toward the spot where he had seen the face, shouting at the
same time, with all the strength of which he was capable, in
the hope of arousing him to do something for himself.</p>

<p>The most skillful swimmer can not fight his way through
froth and foam, its specific gravity being too slight for it to
support his weight, while the danger is that he will be
strangled before he can reach the water that will support<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
him. Little Rifle fully understood this before he made his
daring plunge, but the glimpse that he had obtained of the
boy had proved that he had something in his favor that fully
counterbalanced this. The very violence of the foamy waters
was such that it drove all foreign bodies to the surface for a
second or two, without any effort upon their part.</p>

<p>Little Rifle kept his senses about him, as he felt himself
sinking downward, downward, in the resistless grasp of the
current. He had taken a deep inspiration during the instant
he was making his flight through the air, and he now held
his breath until he could gain the chance to renew it.</p>

<p>The crash and roar, the blinding mist and spinning eddies,
the arrow-like descent, these were enough to drive all the
wits from a man&#8217;s brain, and the boy had hardly thrown
himself into the vortex when the conviction flashed upon
him, that the strange boy was not only past all hope but that
he had put himself in the same position by his mad plunge
into the water, in the hope of rescuing him.</p>

<p>But Little Rifle was too brave a lad to yield up his life
without a struggle, and, with all the strength and skill of
which he was master, he made a desperate effort to get his
face to the surface only for a second&mdash;a single instant&mdash;that
he might gain a single breath of the all-revivifying air.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.<br />


<span class="small">OUT OF THE JAWS OF DEATH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> this instant, while Little Rifle was making such a tremendous
effort to save himself, his shoulder struck something.
He supposed that it was the canoe, or that he had grazed a
rock in his meteor-like passage through the water; but, the
wild hope that it was neither of these, caused him to throw
out his arm and clutch at it.</p>

<p>As he did so, he found that he had grasped the arm of the
boy, for whose sake he had made this desperately perilous
attempt.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>Having got it in his grasp, Little Rifle did not let it go
again, but held to it, as though his own life depended upon
the result, while, with the other arm and his feet, he redoubled
his efforts to make the surface of the turbulent current.</p>

<p>The very velocity of the sorely-pressed stream was in favor
of the lads, as it carried them speedily into water heavy
enough to afford a swimmer support; but, before this was
done, and when the brave rescuer felt that he could hold out
no longer, he brought himself and his burden to the top of
the water.</p>

<p>Even in this critical, this fearful moment, when it seemed
that his own body would burst with agony, Little Rifle made
certain that his companion was given the same blessed privilege
before he availed himself of it. He saw him start and
gasp, he felt the arm which was in his grasp feebly start or
struggle, and then, with the lungs of both filled with the delicious
life-giving air, they went down again.</p>

<p>In that momentary sight that Little Rifle had gained of
the face of the boy, during the single instant that it remained
above the water, he caught sight of a red spot of blood upon
the forehead, which showed that he was hurt and bleeding
very fast, else the crimson current could not have shown itself
so quickly.</p>

<p>In a shorter period than before, the two came to the top
of the water again, and Little Rifle, with a thrill of hope,
found that they were beyond the light, fleecy foam, and were
speeding downward through water in which he was able to
support both himself and his charge.</p>

<p>The skill of the young trapper was as great in the handling
of himself while in the water as it was in hunting or trailing
through the woods, and now his confidence came back to
him, when he felt certain that he could accomplish something
by that same skill and strength.</p>

<p>Still retaining his hold upon the arm of the boy, he
managed to bring his head above the surface once more,
while with the other arm he impelled both through the water,
toward the bank, from which he had made his leap.</p>

<p>The current was still so swift that he could hardly hope
to effect a landing until they should reach a point further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
down, but it was prudent to put himself in a position where he
could avail himself of the first turn in his favor.</p>

<p>Looking again at the countenance by his shoulder, he saw
that the eyes were closed, and there was blood flowing over
his face.</p>

<p>The sight convinced Little Rifle that he must speedily be
gotten out of the water, if he expected to preserve his life at
all, and he now bent all his efforts toward reaching the shore
with him.</p>

<p>A few vigorous strokes brought him within a dozen feet of
land, but the bank was so rocky and precipitous that it was
idle to attempt to come out, and he drifted, unresisting, still
further.</p>

<p>By this time they were scarcely less than a quarter of a
mile below the falls, so swiftly had they sped downward, and
being so close to shore, Little Rifle determined to make a
desperate attempt to land at the first point that offered the
least hope.</p>

<p>Suddenly he saw an opening in the rocks, a place where
they were so depressed that he could reach the upper edge
with his hands, if he could bring himself sufficiently near.</p>

<p>A furious plunge forward, and he succeeded. Throwing
up his free arm, he grasped the rim, but the swiftness of the
current, and the support of the helpless lad, instantly tore his
grasp loose, and both sped onward again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make it next time,&#8221; was his thought, as his courage
rose with the difficulty. &#8220;The stream is broadening, and
must run a great deal slower. I will soon find a footing, and
when I can secure that, I will bring us both out all right.
He is alive,&#8221; he mentally added, as he looked at him again,
&#8220;for he has struggled more than once, but he is badly hurt,
and he may die, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then, Little Rifle&#8217;s moccasins struck the bottom, and,
as they were drawn up, in his efforts at swimming, this showed
that the water was quite shallow. Instantly dropping his
feet, he stood with it rising scarcely above his waist; but
even then it was the utmost he could do to retain his footing,
so powerful was the sweep of the current.</p>

<p>He succeeded by a strong effort, and never losing his hold
upon his charge, dragged him to shore and stretched him out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
at full length upon his back, where the sun could shine full
upon his face.</p>

<p>The boy lay like one that was dead, with his eyes partly
closed, and the blood trickling from the wound in his forehead.
For a moment, the heart of Little Rifle seemed to
stand still, as he believed that it was all over with him, and
he knelt down to make sure.</p>

<p>Examining the wound, he found that it was much less
serious than he had supposed, the bone of the forehead being
unbroken. It had probably been caused, not by striking the
jagged point of a rock in his fearful descent, but when driven
about by the whirlpool or current, his head must have grazed
some of the numerous projections, causing only a superficial
wound, where, in the other case, instant death would have
been the result.</p>

<p>Little Rifle tore a piece of the fringe from his hunting-shirt,
and with it endeavored to stanch the flow of blood. As
he pressed it against the raw wound, the forehead of the lad
contracted as though with pain. Little Rifle paused for an
instant, and then did it more gently than before. At this
the sufferer opened his eyes, looking up with a vacant, bewildered
stare, like one recovering from a sound sleep.</p>

<p>His attendant now raised his head upon his knee, and endeavored
to rouse him to consciousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheer up, my young friend, you are past all danger now;
you have had a trip that you can boast of as long as you
live. How do you feel?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the faculties of the boy were knocked up too much
for him to comprehend his situation. He mumbled something
that was unintelligible, and then closed his eyes as if to
sink into a slumber.</p>

<p>Little Rifle was at a loss to understand what this meant
but he feared it was a bad sign, and now that he had begun,
he determined to arouse him to a full sense of his position.
He shook him quite violently, all the time speaking in a loud
voice, and fighting off his drowsy tendency. The lad had
swallowed a large quantity of water, which, having thrown
out, he began to show some evidence of his returning faculties.</p>

<p>Looking steadily in the face of Little Rifle, he glanced at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
the rapid river flowing by at their feet, and then seeming to
comprehend, for the first time, he spoke with some coherence.</p>

<p>&#8220;And is it possible that I came over these falls and live
to remember it? It can not be possible; it is incredible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is true for all that,&#8221; replied Little Rifle, with a
smile of delight. &#8220;You have a slight wound upon your
forehead; but if that is all, you will soon be all right again.
Just examine yourself and see whether you have any other
injuries.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy stretched his limbs, and with some assistance got
upon his legs, hobbling about for several minutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are in order, and it seems I haven&#8217;t got any thing
broken but my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor that either,&#8221; said his friend, his pleasure showing
itself in his radiant face and the tones of his voice. &#8220;You
have had a great shaking up, but it was a most wonderful
escape. You will go with me to my home and remain with
me until you recover your strength, or until you are anxious
to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your home?&#8221; repeated the stranger, in amazement;
&#8220;have you a home in this wilderness?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with me and you shall see,&#8221; replied Little Rifle,
flushing, and dropping his eyes with confusion to the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, lead the way, only don&#8217;t walk too fast, for I
feel a little rheumatic in my joints, and can&#8217;t get along
fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the boy hobbled forward again, leaning upon the arm
of his friend, something dropped from his bosom, and as he
stooped to pick it up he said, with a laugh:</p>

<p>&#8220;I lost my oar, hat and gun, but the spy-glass stuck by me
to the last, perhaps because I could better afford to part with
that than any of the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will go back by the falls,&#8221; said Little Rifle, &#8220;for I
left my gun there when I jumped into the water. Then we
will take the nearest cut home, and get there, I hope, in the
course of a few hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See here!&#8221; said the other, pausing for a moment, &#8220;ain&#8217;t
there any Indians there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will look out for them,&#8221; was the reply; &#8220;but tell me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
how it was you came to be alone in your canoe on the
river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you as we walk along, for it is quite a long
story. What is your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They call me Little Rifle,&#8221; replied the lad, with no little
embarrassment of manner, &#8220;and if you please, you may do
the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An odd name, but rather pretty. You may call me
Harry Northend. I don&#8217;t suppose you remember ever seeing
me before?&#8221; he asked, in a significant manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; returned Little Rifle, greatly surprised.
&#8220;Why do you ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Because I have seen you before!</i>&#8221;</p>

<span class="small">NEW FRIENDS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Rifle</span> and Harry stood side by side on the margin
of the stream down which the latter had made his frightful
plunge, and from which he had been rescued by the daring
young trapper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; repeated Harry, with a meaning laugh, &#8220;I have seen
you before, if you haven&#8217;t seen me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure you are mistaken,&#8221; replied Little Rifle, embarrassed
at his persistency. &#8220;I have lived among the mountains
and woods ever since I can remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s where I saw you,&#8221; added Harry, who seemed
to recover his strength and spirits with remarkable celerity.
&#8220;I wonder, now, whether you were not lying in the back part
of a canoe, this morning, half-asleep, without suspecting that
a big Blackfoot Indian was creeping up to you with his tomahawk
in hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Harry laughed, as if he had just heard the funniest
joke of his life.</p>

<p>A light began to break in upon the mind of Little Rifle.
How could his new acquaintance know any thing of that incident,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
which neither himself nor Ruff Robsart had told to
any one?</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> are the one who fired the gun that saved me!&#8221; he
exclaimed, reaching out to take the hand of Harry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I am,&#8221; replied the latter, as he returned the
grasp. &#8220;I happened to be hunting along that creek when I
caught sight of your canoe, and I stood trying to make out
whether you were an Indian or a white man. I was going to
call to you two or three times, but I thought you were a red-skin,
as the hunters call them; for you know I couldn&#8217;t see
your face, and you were dressed very much like one. Just as
I was about to turn away I caught sight of the Blackfoot
stealing toward you&mdash;and you know the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why didn&#8217;t you wait and speak to us. We crossed
over to hunt you out, but Old Ruff himself couldn&#8217;t find your
trail, even.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I took pains to travel over the rocks and stones as much
as I could so as to keep you from finding my tracks. I didn&#8217;t
wait to see this Old Ruff that you are talking about, because
I still believed that you were an Indian belonging to some
other tribe, and I couldn&#8217;t bear to see you killed in such a
cowardly manner, so I made myself as scarce as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how, then, do you recognize me <i>now</i>?&#8221; asked Little
Rifle, in wonder, &#8220;when you say you didn&#8217;t see my
face?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By that cap, which I did see, and which isn&#8217;t the kind of
plug an Indian sports.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little Rifle laughed at the lively, off-hand manner of his
new friend, who seemed to have forgotten entirely his recent
terrible experience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, since you would not give me the chance then,
I will take it now, and thank you from the bottom of my
heart for the service you did me, when without it I should
have been killed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it was a good turn, but then it can&#8217;t compare
with your act. <i>I</i> didn&#8217;t run any particular risk, while you
knew, when you jumped into the raging water, that the
chances were altogether against your ever coming out again.
However, we won&#8217;t fight over such a dispute; we&#8217;re bound to
be friends for life, so give us your hand on it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>And the two shook hands warmly, in a way, too, that showed
they meant it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you, Little Rifle, there is something about you that
I like,&#8221; in his dashing, captivating style. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got pluck,
and I like to see that in anybody, and then you&#8217;re as modest
and backward as a girl; you haven&#8217;t got the brass and style
and vices of civilization, and I hope you never will, and so it
won&#8217;t spoil you when I tell you that you&#8217;ve got the handsomest
face that I ever saw on a pair of shoulders&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There! there!&#8221; protested Little Rifle, flushing to his temples,
&#8220;please don&#8217;t go on in that way, but tell me something
about yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose I ought to. You know what my name
is; my father has an interest in the Missouri Fur Company,
and has come out prospecting in this part of the world. We
came up the Missouri and Yellowstone as far as the boat could
travel, and then, with a party of hunters, made the rest of the
journey on horseback. So, you see, I got considerable experience
in the woods on our way, though I haven&#8217;t had much
chance to learn how to manage one of these confounded canoes.
We reached Fort Abercrombie, which I suppose you&#8217;ve
heard of, about a week ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have been there several times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, from there father concluded to make a trip up into
British America, and gave me the choice of staying where I
was, or of going with him and his party. I found out from
the men at the fort that there is a great deal better hunting
in Oregon than there is further north, so that is how I came
to stay behind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And is it possible that you are so far away from the fort
without some hunter or trapper who knows the country being
with you?&#8221; asked Little Rifle, staring at him, in amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; he responded, coolly. &#8220;Father didn&#8217;t forbid
me to go out hunting, but rather encouraged it. I find there
are a few more waterfalls and Indians than I thought, but I
am getting used to them. Since you&#8217;ve told me your name,
Little Rifle, I call to mind, too, that I have heard it at the
fort. Old Ruff, as you call him, the noted old Hill Trapper,
has you in charge. Isn&#8217;t that the case?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; replied Little Rifle, as they picked their
way along over the rocks, in the direction of the falls. &#8220;I
have lived with him ever since I can remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he is not your father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; nor can he tell who my parents are. Many years
ago, when I was an infant, he took me from a deserted Indian
lodge. I was left at the fort, while he made every effort
in his power to find out something of my history; but he
has never succeeded, and is as ignorant of it to-day as you
are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is wonderful,&#8221; said Harry, deeply impressed with the
romantic narrative; &#8220;were you dressed in Indian clothes at
the time? Were there no marks by which some trace of your
parentage could be gained?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None at all,&#8221; replied the young lad, with a sad shake of
his head. &#8220;I do not even know my name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it that they call you Little Rifle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When old Ruff Robsart took me out of the Indian lodge,
there was a small gun, beautifully mounted, suspended over
my head, which he brought away with him, and kept until I
was big enough to begin to use it. At the fort they christened
me Little Rifle, and the name has stuck to me ever
since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the gun now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I laid it upon the rocks when I jumped into the water
to help you out, as I would have been sure to lose it. I am
on my way now to recover it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be hard for me to guess where mine is,&#8221; laughed
Harry, with a half-quizzical look at the falls, which were now
close at hand. &#8220;As a paddle, it wasn&#8217;t much of a success,
and I don&#8217;t think it fared much better than the canoe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have a spare rifle or two at the cabin, and I shall
be glad to present you with one. In fact you have a claim
to one of them, for it belonged to the Blackfoot that you
shot this morning and looks like a good piece; though it is
of the regular size.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so was the one I lost. Father bought me a couple
of boys&#8217; guns in St. Louis, and I lost one in the Yellowstone,
when I was watching to get a crack at some wild-fowl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What became of the other?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>&#8220;I kept that till we had left the Yellowstone, and were
well on our way over the mountains. I got tired of carrying
it slung over my shoulder, where there wasn&#8217;t any chance
of getting a crack at any thing like game&mdash;so I had it strapped
to the back of a mule, and he took it into his head one
day to roll over without waiting for his load to be unstrapped.
When he had finished, my gun was in seven different pieces.
Then I took an ordinary rifle, such as the men carry, and
have gotten along with that ever since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yonder is mine,&#8221; said Little Rifle, pointing to where
his weapon lay; &#8220;wait here until I return, and you can examine
it for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>With these words, the lad bounded forward like a chamois,
and picking up his piece, brought it back to Harry, who
took it into his hand to examine it.</p>

<p>&#8220;A splendid gun,&#8221; was his comment, as he turned it over
and over in his hand; &#8220;but, hello! what does this mean?
There are two letters, &#8216;<i>H. R.</i>&#8217;, engraven on the stock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were there when Old Ruff found it. Neither of
us know what they mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They must be the initials of the man who owned the
gun. No doubt he was your father; I see his surname begins
with <i>R.</i>, but I don&#8217;t suppose it can be Rifle, like yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; hardly that,&#8221; replied the boy, compelled to laugh
at the manner of his companion. &#8220;There must be thousands
of names that begin in the same way, so those letters have
been of no help at all to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at present, but when I go back to the fort, I&#8217;m
going to set out to find who you are, and where you came
from, and I&#8217;m never going to go back East until I do learn.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Little Rifle heard these words, the longing, strange
yearning came to him, and he could not avoid asking himself
the question, whether this friend was not the instrument
sent by Heaven to introduce him into the world, and to unlock
the mystery that shrouded his history.</p>

<p>His declaration of what he intended to do, stirred Little
Rifle&#8217;s hopes, and as he looked furtively at the boy, he saw
his lips compressed and his eyes flashing, in a way that
proved how deeply in earnest he was.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would be glad,&#8221; said Little Rifle, with a sigh, &#8220;to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
you clear up the doubt that covers the past, but I do not
believe there is any chance of success.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You can&#8217;t tell about that</i>,&#8221; replied Harry, in a resolute, decided
way! &#8220;If a continued search can not find out, we
sometimes come upon it by chance. I know you are anxious
to learn, and I shall never give over my efforts until I
find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he said this, he passed the gun back to the owner, and
they turned off from the falls, where the din and roar prevented
them from conversing without great difficulty.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder whether any of those Indians saw me,&#8221; continued
Harry. &#8220;I was out hunting when I found that canoe,
and thought I would get in and practice a little, for canoe-paddling
is my weak point, and it is the hardest thing in the
world for me to get the hang of the thing. Before I knew
it, I come right smack in front of those lodges, and finding
I couldn&#8217;t paddle up-stream, I just lay down, and trusted to
Providence to take me through all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw you,&#8221; laughed Little Rifle, &#8220;for I was watching
the lodges from the other side the stream, but I didn&#8217;t dare
call to you, for fear the Blackfeet would hear me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There were Indians in them then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I saw them, but they didn&#8217;t come out to the water
until you were far down the stream. I could just see your
canoe going around the curve above the falls, when they
looked down the river. I can&#8217;t say whether they saw you or
not, but they acted to me as though they did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They have wonderfully sharp eyes, and if <i>you</i> could see
me, you can make up your mind that they could and did&mdash;so
we had better be on the look-out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what if they did?&#8221; was the reassuring reply of
Little Rifle. &#8220;Where will they look for you and the canoe
now? If they find you both went over the falls, will they
hunt any further for you?&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.<br />


<span class="small">&#8220;THE CAVE OF WINDS.&#8221;</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Notwithstanding</span> the reassuring words of Little Rifle,
both he and Harry deemed it best to make a cautious survey
of the river above the falls, before leaving their vicinity.
It was possible that a party of Blackfeet might be in their
immediate vicinity, in which case they were in imminent
danger of being seen and pursued, while if their presence was
unsuspected by the red-skins they could continue their journey
homeward, with very little fear of any molestation from
foes in the rear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remain here while I climb up above the falls,&#8221; said Little
Rifle, &#8220;it will take but two or three minutes at most.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have a care,&#8221; admonished Harry, &#8220;for these red-skins
are mighty sharp, and I think can see around a corner.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young trapper smiled to think that his new acquaintance
should deem him in need of advice, in such a business,
but he continued as cautiously and carefully upward as if
he was sure of finding Blackfeet there.</p>

<p>And so there were, as he very speedily found out. Where
in the name of the seven wonders they came from he could
not guess, but he saw half a dozen, just above the falls upon
the other side, groping their way down-stream, and still more
upon the same side with himself coming directly toward
him! This latter party were scarcely a hundred feet distant,
and in a few minutes would reach the spot where he
was. This was a most alarming state of affairs, and Little
Rifle had to think and act at once. One glance was sufficient
to tell him the whole story, and hastily backing out from
his perilous position, he scrambled back to where the wondering
Harry was awaiting him.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are coming!&#8221; he exclaimed in a terrified whisper;
&#8220;there is a whole party, and they&#8217;ll be here in a minute.
Where shall we hide?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hanged if I know!&#8221; replied Harry, fully as startled as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
his friend, and with less presence of mind. &#8220;Let&#8217;s jump
into the water again, and keep diving.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such a course would not have been recommended by the
lad in his cooler moments, and it did not affect Little Rifle
in the least. He looked vainly around in quest of some
rock that offered a chance to hide, and when he was actually
meditating going forward and surrendering himself, in the
hope of being ransomed by the authorities at the fort, there
flashed upon him, as if by inspiration, a remark that he once
heard Old Ruff Robsart make about a cavern behind the
falls into which he once made his way.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s our only chance!&#8221; he exclaimed, dashing toward the
water. &#8220;Come on, Harry! it is death or life with us!&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Northend had no idea what he meant, but he did
not hesitate to follow him at full speed, so that he reached
the spot scarcely behind him.</p>

<p>Little Rifle dashed down among the rocks, and reaching
the edge of the water, at the very edge or side of the falls,
he paused, and looked despairingly around. He could see
nothing like a cavern, nor any thing that seemed to afford an
entrance to such a retreat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we shall have to give it up,&#8221; he shouted to Harry,
who, unable to catch a syllable in the thunderous din, but
understanding the trouble, pointed ahead and yelled:</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a chance to make your way through to something
else!&#8221;</p>

<p>Neither did Little Rifle hear a word uttered by his comrade,
but the motion of his lips, and the gesture of his hand indicated
sufficiently well what he meant.</p>

<p>Following the direction indicated, he saw through a thin
sheet of water, scarcely thicker than the soap bubble, and
that reflected the prismatic hues, the dark outlines of a rock,
that scarcely was as high as his waist and which was within
easy leaping distance.</p>

<p>Not a second was to be lost, and Little Rifle had no sooner
detected it than he made a spring, cleaving through the gauzy
vail, and striking the flat surface of the rock, which was so
slippery that his feet slid forward, and he fell flat upon his
back.</p>

<p>Before he could gather himself up, Harry followed, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
too sprawled at full length, neither receiving any injury, and
both assuming the perpendicular almost at the same moment.</p>

<p>The fear of Little Rifle was that by plunging through the
feathery sheet, and temporarily breaking it, they had dissolved
it altogether, and failing to reunite, it would leave not only
the rock upon which they stood, but themselves, in full view
of the Blackfeet, as soon as they should descend the rocks and
place themselves below the falls.</p>

<p>But the screen instantly resumed its normal place, and
spread over them like a fan of the thinnest glass, shutting
them in, but permitting them to look through upon the outer
world. Its transparency, or rather its texture, however, was
not like that of a perfect window-pane, but it was faulty,
abounding with tremulous nebul&aelig; here and there that gave a
fanciful, grotesque imagery to the objects upon which the eye
rested, and that as a consequence, made the picture of themselves
equally untrue to nature.</p>

<p>Still, although they had reasonably increased their chances
of eluding the Blackfeet, they were in danger, so long as they
maintained their present position, and both cast about to discover
what their facilities were in the way of a further retreat.</p>

<p>The result was better than they dared to hope. The sheet
of water that poured over their heads was fully a hundred
feet in width, and the black, slippery rock stretched clean
across beneath it, with a width varying from ten to a dozen
feet.</p>

<p>The instant Little Rifle discovered this gratifying fact, he
began picking his way carefully along, closely followed by
Harry.</p>

<p>When they had reached the center, they paused by a common
instinct, feeling that they could not increase their chance
of safety by going further; and here, as they stood side by
side, they looked upon the scene with emotions of wonder,
amazement and awe.</p>

<p>Above them, to a great height, the black, dripping rocks
extended like the jagged irregular roof of some cavern, gradually
making their way outward, until they formed the ledge
over which the entire river swept in its resistless majesty.</p>

<p>It may be said indeed that they stood in a cavern, one side
of which was composed of the wet, inky rocks, and the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
was the volume of water, converging both in front and back
of them, so that the open space resembled a cone in shape.</p>

<p>Looking upward the mighty mass of water had a deep emerald
tinge, like melted glass, and through its translucent
depth, the sunlight could only partially penetrate, so that they
were enshrouded in a sort of misty twilight. To the left, as
they picked their way along the ledge, this volume was white,
foamy and impenetrable to the eye, and looking down, the
boiling, tumbling, roaring, seething battle of the water was of
such an appalling nature as to make the strongest man shiver
and draw back with affright, as though he had caught a
glimpse of the Plutonian regions.</p>

<p>For a few moments the lads forgot all about their danger
from the Indians in the terror inspired by the stupendous
scene, and they stood looking up, around and below them with
feelings to which no adequate expression can be given. Then
they looked in each other&#8217;s faces, and Harry spoke.</p>

<p>Little Rifle saw his lips move, and placed his ear to them.
The boy shouted with all the strength of which he was capable,
but, although their heads touched each other, the young
trapper could not catch a syllable, and looking again in each
other&#8217;s faces, they laughed and shook their heads, as an acknowledgment
that their tongues were of no present use to
them.</p>

<p>They were in a world where the language must be one of
signs. Little Rifle looked beyond him and pointed to a dark,
forbidding opening, which looked as if it were the entrance-way
to some vast subterranean chamber; he moved carefully
toward it, doubtless recalling something that Old Ruff had told
him about his explorations in the same direction, and the truth
of which he proposed to test.</p>

<p>Harry, instead of picking his way after him, remained
standing where he was, until he saw that he had passed the
most dangerous point. Then, concluding that it was best to
find out whether there was any danger approaching from the
Indians, he began retracing his steps to where he and his friend
had landed upon their backs.</p>

<p>The moment he reached a point where he could gain a partial
view of the outside, he halted, so as not to run too great
a risk of being seen by any of their enemies.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>It was well that he did so, for at that very instant he descried
the dreaded Blackfeet. They were of gigantic size and
grotesque shape, as viewed dimly through the glassy sheet
that intervened, but they were Indians unmistakably, and three
of them were standing upon the very rock from which he and
Little Rifle had made their leap but a few minutes before.</p>

<p>&#8220;I always believed that when a fellow traveled over the
rocks he didn&#8217;t leave any trail behind him,&#8221; thought Harry, as
he stealthily viewed the red-skins; &#8220;but it does seem that you
can&#8217;t hide yourself from those Blackfeet. I shouldn&#8217;t wonder,
now, if they have been tracking the canoe through the water,
and have come down below the falls to pick up the trail
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>But second thought convinced the lad that the Indians must
be aware of the existence of this &#8220;Cave of the Winds,&#8221; and
that they must have discovered some traces of other parties
being there. He could see their arms sawing the air, and
moving about in a way that showed very clearly that they,
too, were using the language of signs in the presence of the
thunderous noise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do believe that they are discussing the question as to
who shall take the first leap,&#8221; thought Harry, as, stretched flat
upon his face, he anxiously watched their movements. &#8220;And
what do they want to come here for, unless it is to gobble us
up?&#8221;</p>

<p>A very natural conclusion, under the circumstances, and
Harry concluded that if such were really the case, it was high
time that they should take some precautions to stave off the
peril.</p>

<p>He had no gun with him, and it was not in the nature of
things that he should consider himself equal to the task of
grasping with a sinewy Indian, most probably in the prime
of life.</p>

<p>So he looked about to see what had become of Little Rifle.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI.<br />


<span class="small">THUNDER ALL AROUND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> stood the daring young trapper, directly behind him.
He, too, had recalled the danger, and was at bay, holding his
rifle, cocked and grasped, ready to discharge the instant it
should become necessary.</p>

<p>Both of the lads were saturated with water, for besides
their recent plunge into the river, there was a damp moistness
in the air, like a copious dew, that would have rendered their
garments dripping with water, supposing they had been dry
at the time they entered this Cave of the Winds.</p>

<p>His gun could not be otherwise than wet, but the charge
was dry, and it could be relied upon to do its duty in case of
an emergency; and it was well that it was thus, for the danger
was at hand.</p>

<p>Seeing that he was backed up by his young friend, Harry
withdrew his gaze from him and resumed his scrutiny of the
three Blackfeet, still standing in full view upon the rock.</p>

<p>He had no more than turned his head when one of the Indians
took a step forward. There was a pause, and then he
burst through the thin, glassy sheet, as he made his plunge,
his dark body being seen for one instant in mid-air, incased in
the transparent setting, and then the crouching body landed
almost upon the head of Harry, who hastily drew back to
avoid a collision with him.</p>

<p>Moving forward to grapple with the red-skin and to endeavor
to throw him over the ledge before he could recover, he
saw him with amazement roll over as if in great agony,
and then, dropping like a log from the slippery rock, he instantly
shot down from sight, vanishing in the seething waters
below&mdash;gone from human sight forever.</p>

<p>All this took place in such a brief space of time that Harry
was completely puzzled to understand what it meant. He
could divine no reason why the Blackfoot, after effecting a
landing, should take it into his head to commit suicide in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
fashion. It was impossible that he should have lost his footing
so completely that he was unable to prevent the catastrophe,
and yet what else could have done it?</p>

<p>In his perplexity he turned about again to see whether Little
Rifle could gesticulate any explanation, and the young
trapper did, so effectually that it could not be misunderstood,
for, as Harry glanced at him, he was in the act of ramming
home another charge in his rifle.</p>

<p>This explained it all. Little Rifle was prepared, and the
instant the red-skin broke through the glassy sheet of water,
he had fired, giving him an almost instantly fatal wound.</p>

<p>What a vivid realization of the deafening roar of the water,
that the gun, although fired directly over his head, and almost
within arm&#8217;s-length, still failed to give him the slightest report.</p>

<p>Little Rifle now showed a keenness of perception and a fertility
of resources which in reality was nothing short of the
wonderful. As he stood with his rifle held to his shoulder,
and his finger pressing the trigger, his view of the Indian
bursting through the sheet of water, like the athlete of the
hippodrome leaping through the ring of paper, was sharply
distinct, although but for a passing moment of time.</p>

<p>The expression upon the face of the Blackfoot was that of
surprise at seeing the two lads before him. He did not expect
to see them&mdash;was not looking for them, and the red-skins
who remained upon the outside were not aware of their being
there.</p>

<p>This, as all will see, was a great point in favor of the lads,
if the deception could be continued; but there was the imminent
danger that the rest of the Blackfeet, waiting in vain
for the return of their comrade, would discover the truth. In
such a case, a desperate fight, with the certainty of a fatal result
upon the part of the lads, was sure to follow.</p>

<p>Comprehending the nature of the Indian, with its childish
credulity and superstition, Little Rifle determined to appeal to
this weakness. The Blackfeet believe that the waterfalls of
their country are haunted by spirits, and knowing of the existence
of the cavern in the rear of this, they could not but
look upon the act of their companion as one of daring intrepidity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>The young trapper touched the arm of Harry, and motioned
for him to draw back out of the way, while he crept forward
until his eyes were at a point where he could see the Indians
without showing himself. He waited only long enough to see
that fully a half-dozen were clustered upon the rocks, where
he suspected they were discussing the action of their companion.</p>

<p>Little Rifle then pushed his gun forward, and pulled the
trigger. It was not aimed at the group, for he had no desire
to injure any of them, unless compelled to do so in self-defense,
but through the gauzy vail every one of them must have
caught sight of the sheet of fire, without hearing any thing of
the report.</p>

<p>This was enough, and they vanished from the spot as suddenly
as if the ground had opened and swallowed them, not
one being visible a dozen seconds afterward.</p>

<p>This was also a huge step forward upon the part of the
boys, but there remained still the difficult necessity of getting
out of their uncomfortable quarters, and making their way
back to the cabin of old Ruff Robsart.</p>

<p>If the Blackfeet had left the rock, it was hardly probable
that they had left the neighborhood, and the moment the boys
should show themselves, they would be in for it again.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, it would seem that there was
really but one course for them to pursue, which was, to remain
where they were until night, and then trust to the assistance
of darkness for them to get away without being discovered.</p>

<p>Such, we say, was the course dictated by common sense and
prudence, and yet a most unexpected and novel cause now appeared
to prevent it. There are few of our readers, perhaps,
who are not aware of the rapidly increasing distress caused
by an unusual sound in the ears, when it is continued for any
length of time. The screaming of a car-whistle, or the near
booming of a cannon, after a while becomes unbearable, and
will drive mad the person who has not become accustomed
to it.</p>

<p>In the excitement of the occasion, and the danger from the
Blackfeet, the lads were insensible to any discomfort from the
overwhelming roar of the falls; but now, when standing directly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
beneath them and reflecting that they would probably
have to wait for hours, they became aware of a growing uneasiness&mdash;a
nervous restlessness, rapidly changing into distress,
which convinced both that they could not maintain their position
and retain their senses at the same time. It would not
be long before the time would come when they would be
willing to incur any risk to escape the intolerable anguish of
this uproar.</p>

<p>Harry was ready to make the leap at once, but Little Rifle
had hopes of accomplishing the result by another plan. It
will be remembered that he had started to explore what seemed
to be a cavern, the opening of which was but a short distance
away; but he had withdrawn from the attempt under the
conviction that there was more imminent need of him elsewhere.</p>

<p>He was now ready to take up the work again, and motioning
for Harry to follow, he moved toward the dark,
forbidding depth of what might be an interminable cavern.</p>

<p>To give himself the free use of his arms, he had strapped
his rifle to his back, and he now groped cautiously along,
like a man feeling his way in a dark room.</p>

<p>Of course the darkness rapidly deepened, until in a few
minutes it became impenetrable. The floor of the cavern
was slippery, and the utmost care was necessary to prevent
a fatal catastrophe. When their eyes became of no further
use, both sunk upon their hands and knees, and crept along
in this fashion, Harry keeping so close that he could touch
the foot of Little Rifle, who used one hand, as an elephant
uses his trunk in venturing upon a treacherous support.</p>

<p>Two noteworthy facts impressed themselves upon the
lads. The floor of the cavern was becoming freer from
dampness, and after a time was absolutely dry&mdash;a most gratifying
change, for they had had so much of water during
the last few hours, that it seemed to both that a day or two
of scorching thirst would be acceptable, as a means of relief.</p>

<p>Again the floor of the cavern was ascending, very gradually,
but none the less positively for all that. Little Rifle suspected
that the dryness of the rocks, over which they were
crawling, meant that they had passed from beneath the river<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
bed, and were under the solid earth, but with little prospect
of ever reaching the surface.</p>

<p>But the most gratifying and welcome fact of all, was that
they were getting away from the tormenting uproar of the
waterfall. With every foot they advanced through the labyrinthine
cavern, that terrible continuous crash grew less and
less distinct, until it finally sounded like the dull roar of the
distant ocean.</p>

<p>The relief was unspeakable, and the ringing din in their
ears speedily subsided, so that they began to feel something
like their natural selves again. It would be easy enough for
them to remain in this part of the cavern until the coming
of night, and Little Rifle concluded that this was what they
would do.</p>

<p>As they got further away from the tumult, of course they
found use for their tongues, and, as may be supposed, they
made good use of them, as a sort of recompense for their
enforced idleness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose the Blackfeet follow us here?&#8221; inquired Harry
Northend.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there is any danger,&#8221; replied Little Rifle,
who then made known&mdash;what we have already stated to
the reader&mdash;his belief that the Indian whom they had shot,
was not in pursuit of the lads, and indeed did not know or
suspect their presence behind the falls. This theory was entirely
new to his friend, who, after hearing the reasons for
his belief, was disposed to believe it implicitly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then all we have to do,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;is to wait here
until night comes, and go out the same way that we came
in. Isn&#8217;t that it, Little Rifle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid it is, unless we can find some other way
out. What time of day is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be past noon; I remember just before I went
over the falls, that I took my last look, as I supposed, at the
sun, and it was then directly overhead, so it must have been
about mid-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned Little Rifle, &#8220;the afternoon is only fairly
begun, for things have moved lively with us, since then.
If we stay here until night, we have got a good six hours&#8217;
stretch before us at least. I have waited many a time for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
a much longer period than that, but it isn&#8217;t the most pleasant
thing to do, especially when you don&#8217;t know whether
you are going to make any thing by it or not. I hope we
can do better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have hinted that same thing before,&#8221; said Harry;
&#8220;what do you mean by it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that I told you that Old Ruff Robsart has
been here before us. It was a long time ago, and I do not
remember what he told me; but I suspect that he found his
way out by a different passage from the one he used in entering.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you think there is a possibility of our finding the
passage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;although there isn&#8217;t much hope either, but I would
rather be moving about, even if we don&#8217;t find any thing to
pay us, than to stay here, and wait till the night comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So would I,&#8221; added Harry, in his cheery voice. &#8220;I got
a little crack just now from something against the sore on
my head, that stung me a little&mdash;but it is all over now.
Lead on, and I will follow. If you are going to change
your gait, give me notice, so that we don&#8217;t get separated.&#8221;</p>

<p>Promising that he would do as requested, Little Rifle
continued his progress.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII.<br />


<span class="small">IN THE MESHES OF THE LABYRINTH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a pleasurable excitement in thus advancing
into the unknown, and the lads experienced something of the
emotion of the navigator, who penetrates for the first time
into some hitherto undiscovered waste of waters; but it may
be noted as a rather curious fact that neither of the lads apprehended
the very peril to which they were thus exposing
themselves until it was upon them. We refer to the certainty
of their going astray in case they continued their explorations
too far.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we only had a guide or a torch as the visitors do in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
the Mammoth Cave, this would be the biggest kind of fun,&#8221;
said Harry, as they continued creeping stealthily along.</p>

<p>Little Rifle wondered what he meant by the Mammoth
Cave, but his shy bashfulness prevented his asking any questions.
He preferred to remain in ignorance until some more
fitting occasion should arise.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we carried torches, they would be likely to be guiding
points to the Indians,&#8221; said Little Rifle; &#8220;it will be safer to
grope along without them, for some of those Blackfeet may
be brave enough to try and learn something more about the
Spirit of the Waterfall, whose eye flashed out upon them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who gobbled up one of their warriors,&#8221; added Harry.
&#8220;By jingo! why didn&#8217;t I think of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think of what?&#8221; asked Little Rifle, not knowing to what
he referred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that I have a match-safe in my pocket, pretty full
of matches too. If they are dry enough to ignite, you haven&#8217;t
any objection, have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; go ahead,&#8221; replied the young trapper, who was desirous
of getting a look at the interior. &#8220;If there&#8217;s any danger,
they can be put out as soon as they are lit.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the innermost recess of his pockets, Harry drew out
his match-safe, and for a wonder, found that it had done what
it was warranted to do, that is, preserved the lucifers from
dampness.</p>

<p>One of these was drawn against the dry rock beneath their
feet, and, as it grew into a flickering flame, he held it above
his head, and the two lads looked about them with no little
curiosity.</p>

<p>This temporary twinkling of light seemed to make the
gloom more terrible and impressive. In the hasty glance that
they cast around, they saw the roof of the cavern composed
of enormous masses of rock, black, jagged and awful, while
before and around them the terrible sight stretched away,
further than the eye could penetrate.</p>

<p>As soon as the match expired, Harry lit another, and continued
this until he had burned a dozen and blistered his
thumb and fingers. During this interesting period also, seeing
that the ground was unobstructed in front, they advanced
fully a hundred yards&mdash;only to see, however, no termination to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
the cavern, whose immensity Harry declared as his belief, exceeded
that of the pride and boast of Kentucky. The floor
over which they walked, in places was dry as dust, again
gravelly, and then again hard, dry rock. In no direction in
which they looked, and they included every point of the compass&mdash;could
they see any limit to the wonderful freak of
nature.</p>

<p>It looked, indeed, as if they were on the outer boundary of
one of those subterranean wonders which are found in different
parts of our country, and that are unequaled in any portion
of the world.</p>

<p>The sound of the waterfall came to their ears, with a faint
murmur that was scarcely audible, and that caused them to
forget all about it for the time.</p>

<p>The excitement of exploring the cavern gradually wore
away under the monotony of traversing the gloom continually
without meeting any obstruction or variety of any character.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we had a wheelbarrow load of provisions,&#8221; said Harry,
&#8220;we might keep this up for a week or two; but the fact is I
am getting tired. How is it with you, Little Rifle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had enough of it; how long is it since we left the
falls?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think a couple of hours; we have come a good
ways too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall need about all our time to get back, so we had
better start at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be a joke now if we couldn&#8217;t find our way,&#8221;
laughed Harry, as they wheeled about and started back with
a little more assurance than had marked their steps so far.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much of a joke,&#8221; replied Little Rifle, who was sensible
of a thrill of fear, excited by the words of the boy. &#8220;I
have been lost once or twice in the woods, and if you have
ever been in that fix, you know how bad you feel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet I do, for I&#8217;ve been there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think then how much worse it must be to get astray in
a place like this, where it is always dark. Did you ever hear
of any one being lost in the Mammoth Cave?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; they have found their bones there, and nobody dare
go very far into it, without a guide and plenty of torches.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If they get lost, when they have torches to guide them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
how much less is our chance of finding our way back again,
when we haven&#8217;t any thing of the kind!&#8221;</p>

<p>The words and the tone in which this was uttered produced
its effect upon Harry, but it could not dissipate entirely that
flow of spirits which seemed natural to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But they lose their way <i>there</i> only when they have penetrated
to a much greater distance than we; and then we have
a few matches left, and can direct our steps by the sound of
the waterfall. See how much the advantage we have!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark!&#8221;</p>

<p>Both paused in their groping, and listened, but could hear
nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked Harry in a whisper. &#8220;What
was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I stopped to find out whether we can hear the falls; do
you catch the sound?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I hear their roar&mdash;very faint it is true&mdash;but distinct
for all that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be the ringing in our ears, that comes from our
having been so stunned by them. And then you know there
is always a dull hollow sound that seems to belong to such
places.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By jingo! Little Rifle, you scare a fellow. Are you in
earnest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to scare you any more than I have to, but
you are brave enough to face danger when it must be faced,
and it&#8217;s my opinion that neither of us can catch the slightest
sound of the waterfall to guide us back again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or in other words, we are lost in the cavern. Is that
what you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will hardly say that, just yet, although I think the
chances are that way. If you have ever tried to find your
way, when there wasn&#8217;t any moon or stars, you know how
hard work it is. I have been dozens of miles away from
Uncle Ruff, when night has come, and you know I have traveled
the woods and mountains enough to know something
about them, and the best thing I was able to do at such times,
was to camp out and wait for daylight. Sometimes I have
roosted in a tree and sometimes have crawled in among the
rocks. If we are going to find our way out of here, I can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
tell you, Harry, that we have got to keep our wits about
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I want to do,&#8221; replied his friend, in
lugubrious voice, &#8220;but it&#8217;s mighty hard work for a fellow to
keep his head clear, when he hears such talk as that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little Rifle laughed at the words of his friend, and he hastened
to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll never give up till we have to do so. Now, let us
see; we have turned square around, and suppose we are
facing the falls. Let me take your hand, and we will keep
our faces this way as well as we can. If we are right, we
shall soon hear the sound of the waters, and, if we are wrong
it won&#8217;t be long before we shall find it out. Come on!&#8221;</p>

<p>And, hand in hand, they began walking forward in silence,
and each endeavoring by the feeling of the floor beneath
them to tell whether they were pursuing the right path or
not. This was out of the question, and they were not long
in discovering it.</p>

<p>Some fifteen or twenty minutes were passed in this way,
and the conviction was gradually stealing over Little Rifle
that they were lost, when the hearts of both were thrilled at
the unmistakable roar of waters which burst upon their ear
with startling suddenness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; exclaimed the joyous Harry, &#8220;we are upon the
right track. Shall I start and run?&#8221;</p>

<p>And in the exuberance of his joy, he let go of the hand
of his friend, and was in the act of bounding off like a deer,
when Little Rifle caught his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bid good-by to your common sense,&#8221; he said, earnestly.
&#8220;If we are on the right track, we&#8217;ve got plenty of
time, without running the risk of breaking our necks!&#8221;</p>

<p>Harry took the proffered hand again, with an apology for
his rashness, and they progressed slowly and deliberately, but
with a much more confident air than heretofore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you hear how much louder it grows every minute?&#8221;
asked the impulsive lad, almost dragging his friend after him.
&#8220;We have been over this ground before, and what is the
need of such tardiness? We were glad enough to get away
from the falls, but we will be gladder still to get back to
them again.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>But Little Rifle was not to be moved from his deliberate
tread, and he compelled Harry to keep pace with him, though
it was hard work to restrain him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will lose nothing by care!&#8221; he admonished, &#8220;and
can gain nothing by haste. Take my advice, and feel every
step of ground before you put your foot down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Strange we can not see any thing of the water,&#8221; remarked
Harry; &#8220;there ought to be some dim sort of light to show
where we entered, for the sound shows that we are close to
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was still walking forward, in his confident way, when
Little Rifle seized his arm with such violence as almost to
throw him backward to the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before you go a step further, strike one of your
matches.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; replied the lad; &#8220;but what&#8217;s the use of jerking
a fellow&#8217;s arm off, when you want to tell him to do a
thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>After some delay the match was produced and struck, and
it showed them a sight that made their blood run cold with
terror!</p>

<p>Less than two paces in front of Harry Northend yawned a
black abyss, fully twenty feet in width, through whose fathomless
depths roared a torrent of water, with a hollow, reverberating
sound, as if it were hundreds of feet below.</p>

<p>Another moment, and both would have walked over into
eternity.</p>

<p>As the match flickered and fell from the hand of Harry,
he gasped and clutched the arm of his comrade, exclaiming,
in a horrified whisper:</p>

<p>&#8220;What an escape! You saved me again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I doubted from the first,&#8221; he replied, in a calm voice,
&#8220;because the sound was not natural to me. We are lost, as
you can see for yourself; but we will not give up nor keep
idle. It is better to push ahead, if we do get wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! see there!&#8221; exclaimed Harry, the next moment.
&#8220;There is something of a different order.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both saw at the same instant a small, dim point of light,
that looked like the shining of a pale star through mist or
vapor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>&#8220;What can that be?&#8221; he asked, as they paused and gazed
toward it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can not guess even,&#8221; replied Little Rifle; &#8220;let us go toward
it and see whether we can not find out!&#8221;</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII.<br />


<span class="small">THE HOLE IN THE AIR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Rifle</span> and Harry Northend stood in the cavern,
gazing in wonder at the pale, glimmering point of light,
neither able to guess what it could mean.</p>

<p>The first supposition that it was a star was dissipated the
next instant by the consciousness that such a thing was a
physical impossibility, and besides which its appearance was
different. It was apparently several inches in diameter,
something like a hundred yards distant, and at a point considerably
above their heads.</p>

<p>Heeding the terrible warning that they had received, the
lads advanced with great circumspection. Harry willingly
relinquished the place of leader to his companion, knowing
how much more careful and skilled he was in business of this
kind, and how much more likely he was to detect its nature.</p>

<p>Not until they were directly beneath the strange appearance
did they comprehend what it meant. By that time
they found that it was fully a foot in diameter, and that it
was something like fifty feet above their heads.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a window in the cavern,&#8221; said Little Rifle, &#8220;and we
are looking through into the world above us. Let us draw
aside to the side of the cavern, where we can rest and look
up at the hole without stretching our necks so.&#8221;</p>

<p>That which had caught their eyes was simply daylight,
looking dim, pale and weird as it penetrated into the gloom
of the cavern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that is something,&#8221; said Harry; &#8220;we can take a
peep at daylight when we get tired of darkness, and can keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
track of the passing days and nights, if we have got to live
the life of a hermit, for some weeks or months.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little Rifle, greatly wearied with their uncommon exertions,
now stretched out in an easy position, with his head
leaning upon his elbow, and looking up at the opening for
several minutes, as if to think out some mode of escape to
the upper world.</p>

<p>They had lain down in their chosen nook but a short
time, when it became evident that the light overhead was
slowly growing paler and dimmer. This of course they attributed
to the departure of daylight and the coming of night.
It continued steadily to fade, until it vanished from view altogether,
and then they knew that darkness reigned above and
below alike.</p>

<p>Tired and wearied as were the lads, it was not long before
they felt a drowsiness stealing over them, against which neither
made any struggle. Both lying there felt how great was
their dependence upon Heaven to bring them out of their
almost hopeless difficulty, and with a prayer for the protection
and guidance of their Heavenly Father, both sunk off into a
soft, refreshing slumber.</p>

<p>The training and life of Little Rifle made his sleep always
light, although it was as refreshing as nature intended, and so
it came about that he had remained unconscious but a short
time, when he opened his eyes, with the certainty that something
from without had occurred to cause him to do so.</p>

<p>Without moving from his position, he raised his head and
listened.</p>

<p>Nothing but the dull, hollow roar of the cavern filled his
ears, and that was like the very depth of silence itself. Not
even the soft rustling of the night-wind among the trees far
above his head could be detected.</p>

<p>Applying his ear to the earth he instantly heard a regular
<i>tip, tap, tip, tap</i>, as if made by the dropping of water, but
which a moment&#8217;s listening satisfied him was produced by another
cause.</p>

<p>The uncertain character of the noise made it impossible to
tell whether it was near or far, but he judged that it was a
long way off.</p>

<p>But, suddenly he started up, and reaching over shook his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
companion into wakefulness, for he had discovered the meaning
of the singular sound, and it was high time that they
were on their guard!</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Sh!&#8221; whispered Little Rifle; &#8220;there&#8217;s some one in the
cavern besides us,&#8221; he replied, in the same cautious tone. &#8220;I
can hear two persons walking, and they are coming this
way!&#8221;</p>

<p>The steps continued their approach, until, as near as the
boys could judge, they were directly beneath the opening,
and something like fifty feet from the spot where they were
crouching upon the ground. Here they paused, and one of
them said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Give the signal, Tom!&#8221;</p>

<p>A whistle followed, that screeched out like that of a
locomotive engine, awakening strange echoes through the
cavern, and only a few seconds had elapsed when a fainter
reply came back from above their heads. The window was
closed by the obtrusion of some dark body.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helloa! Tom, is that you down there?&#8221; some one called
through the opening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. Come, be lively now, and let down that
rope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; there it comes; look out for it!&#8221;</p>

<p>The listening lads soon heard sounds as if made by a person
in drawing himself up &#8220;hand-over-hand&#8221; by means of
the rope. Such in truth was the case, and a few minutes
after they saw two bodies disappear, one by one, through the
skylight.</p>

<p>What they had heard of course told them that the three
men whose voices they had heard were not Indians but white
men. What their errand was in the cavern, it was hard to
conjecture, as was also the question whether it would be
prudent to advance and make their situation known to
them.</p>

<p>They could catch the muttering mumbling of words far
above, but could not understand a syllable uttered. In a few
moments the sound of voices ceased altogether, for the men
evidently had gone away.</p>

<p>While Little Rifle stood all attention, Harry was groping
around with his hands.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>&#8220;By jingo! they have left the rope hanging down!&#8221; he
exclaimed, in a delighted whisper, as he pushed it toward his
friend. &#8220;I wonder if they didn&#8217;t do that on purpose for us?&#8221;</p>

<p>The young trapper grasped it in his hands, and found that
it was an ordinary hemp rope reaching to the floor of the
cavern, and capable of bearing a heavy strain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! ha!&#8221; softly laughed Little Rifle, &#8220;here is our deliverer,&#8221;
and without a word of explanation the resolute lad
sprung to the ascent, and, hand-over-hand like a sailor, went
up the rope with great agility.</p>

<p>Harry, with an anxiety that may well be imagined, stood
peering upward in the gloom, awaiting the result of this perilous
venture on the part of his friend.</p>

<p>He held the rope grasped in both of his hands, noting, by
its swaying and trembling, the progress made by the daring
young trapper.</p>

<p>By and by the swaying of the rope ceased, by which he
knew that Little Rifle was at the top.</p>

<p>Then Harry himself began the ascent, and had reached
about half-way to the top, when Little Rifle called out, evidently
in a subdued voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Harry! are you down there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I ain&#8217;t; I&#8217;m half-way up,&#8221; he answered, in an imprudently
loud tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on as fast as you can; the way is clear, but there&#8217;s
no telling how long it will remain so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Spurred on by this, Harry hastened on, and was soon up
to the hole. Taking him by the hand, Little Rifle dragged
him from beneath the clump of bushes which served as a
screen to the entrance to the cavern, and then, catching him
by the arm, he compelled Harry to follow him away from the
vicinity.</p>

<p>The moon was high in the sky, and the night was clear
and balmy, inspiring a delicious happiness through the hearts
of the boys, as they realized that they were treading the earth
again, and all present danger was past.</p>

<p>They could hear the murmur of the river, flowing near
them, and making their way toward it, found, as they had suspected,
that the cavern extended a long ways underground,
and had led them a goodly distance away.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>Fortunately they were upon the right side, and it only remained
for them to get over the intervening distance between
them and the cabin where old Robsart made his head-quarters.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV.<br />


<span class="small">A STARTLING SHOT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> light hearts and buoyant spirits the lads made their
way forward. Little Rifle, understanding precisely their situation,
led the way without doubt or hesitation, and in the
course of an hour began ascending the ridge, from which he
had just made his survey of the Indian lodges and the river.</p>

<p>By the time that they had reached the top of the ridge,
the lads were thoroughly worn out, and concluded to encamp
and wait for daylight.</p>

<p>After considerable search, Little Rifle discovered a suitable
hiding-place among the rocks, into which they crawled, and
almost instantly dropped into a deep slumber, and when the
glad sun came up over the mountains, Harry opened his eyes.
As he turned his head to greet his companion, no Little Rifle
was to be seen! The displaced bowlders showed that he
had gone out. But whither?</p>

<p>Crawling cautiously out from his lodgings, Harry discovered
a small, bubbling spring of cool, fresh water, from which
he took a refreshing draught, concluding that he had taken
occasion to reconnoiter, and would shortly put in an appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope he has gone off to scare up a breakfast,&#8221; he mused,
as he sat down by the spring, &#8220;for I&#8217;m hungry enough to
eat a raw Blackfoot&mdash; Helloa!&#8221;</p>

<p>He heard the crackling of undergrowth, and there, scarcely
twenty feet distant, he saw one of the finest and plumpest of
antelopes, coming toward the spring, evidently for the purpose
of obtaining his &#8220;morning bitters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear,&#8221; gasped the boy, as he fixed his eyes upon him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
&#8220;if I only had my gun! I wonder if I can&#8217;t get near enough
to knife him?&#8221;</p>

<p>The instant he moved, the delicate, graceful animal halted,
threw back its head, and fixing it steadily upon him for a single
second, wheeled about and made an affrighted plunge
backward.</p>

<p>&#8220;There goes my breakfast,&#8221; growled the lad, &#8220;and I never
had a meal travel so fast in all my life. Ha! what&#8217;s up now?
He must have hit his toe against something!&#8221;</p>

<p>This exclamation was caused by the sudden tumbling of
the animal, who, rolling all over in a heap, struggled up
again, then fell, and then lay still.</p>

<p>The crack of a rifle, that now reached the ears of the boy,
explained all; the animal had scarcely ceased his struggles,
when Little Rifle emerged from the bushes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully for you!&#8221; shouted Harry, dashing forward the instant
he saw him. &#8220;Don&#8217;t throw away his hoofs and horns,
for I&#8217;m hungry enough to eat them too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;While I&#8217;m getting some slices ready, do you kindle a fire,
Harry, and I&#8217;ll soon give you one of the best meals of your
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too long about it,&#8221; said the boy, as he flew about
to obey the request. &#8220;I think I can hold out about half an
hour longer, and then I&#8217;ll be ready to begin on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>It required but a few minutes to gather a quantity of wood;
but the hungry lad was in such impatient haste that he lost a
great deal of time in starting a fire after it was ready. He
succeeded at last, by which time Little Rifle had two large,
tender slices, from the choicest part of the animal, dressed
and ready for the coals.</p>

<p>Only a few minutes were required to prepare both, and
then the lads made a meal, whose luscious richness can be understood
only by those that have been placed in similar circumstances.
As they crunched through the tender, juicy
steaks, they could only roll their eyes at each other, without
attempting to give expression to their enjoyment. Occasionally
Harry indulged in a groan or sigh of happiness&mdash;but that
was all.</p>

<p>Little Rifle had gauged the capacities of both, with no inconsiderable
skill, and when his friend had made away with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
the last morsel, despite his loud predictions at the beginning
of the meal, he was obliged to confess himself fully satisfied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I could hold more than that,&#8221; he said, looking
wistfully at the remains of the animal, &#8220;but, alas! for
human ambition. Another mouthful and I would explode.&#8221;</p>

<p>As there was no cause for remaining longer where they
were, they made ready to move on again toward old Robsart&#8217;s
head-quarters, where Harry expected to obtain a rifle and
start upon his return to the fort.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you notice that clump of bushes over there?&#8221; asked
Little Rifle, touching his arm and pointing to some scrubby
shrubbery, but a short distance away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; what of it? Is there another antelope there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something, for I have noticed a movement, once
or twice, while we were eating. Look out! there is an Indian
and he is going to fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>And, grasping the shoulder of the lad, he sprung to one
side, dragging him with him. At the same instant there was
a flash and a sharp report, as the bullet whizzed toward
them!</p>

<p>Little Rifle, experienced in the dangers of a hunter&#8217;s life,
was not caught with an unloaded gun. The thin puff of
smoke had hardly begun to curl up from the clump of bushes
when his rifle was at his shoulder, and he sent the return bullet
crashing among the leaves and twigs. At the same moment
both sprung to cover.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t any gun,&#8221; said Little Rifle to his friend, &#8220;so
keep your head out of sight, and if I haven&#8217;t peppered that
red-skin I&#8217;ll do so next time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe there are several of them,&#8221; ventured his friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the young trapper, &#8220;if there were they&#8217;d
have fired when they had the chance. Keep your head down,
Harry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear him groaning and moaning,&#8221; persisted Harry.
&#8220;You must hear it, too. Let&#8217;s go forward, for you&#8217;ve
wounded the poor wretch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! The Blackfoot isn&#8217;t hurt at all, and he is making
those noises on purpose to draw us out. I beseech you,
Harry, to keep quiet.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>But now Little Rifle did the very thing against which he
had so earnestly cautioned his friend. Looking steadily over
the face of the rock for a moment, a strange expression lit up
his face, and he slowly rose to his feet, until his whole body
above his knees was in full view of their hidden foe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I declare if it doesn&#8217;t beat every thing!&#8221; exclaimed
Little Rifle, more to himself than any one else, &#8220;I thought it
was an Indian all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Harry rose to his feet he saw the explanation of this
soliloquy. From behind the all-important clump of bushes
came a large, bushy-whiskered white man, clad in hunter&#8217;s
costume, and apparently in the best of humor.</p>

<p>The hunter, shaking all over with laughter, extended his
broad palm as he came up and closed it around the small
hand of Little Rifle, who, after exchanging a word or two
with him, turned and introduced him to Harry as his Uncle
Robsart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to see you, younker,&#8221; exclaimed the hairy old hunter,
as he gave Harry a hearty shake of the hand. &#8220;Scared
you a little, I s&#8217;pose. I see&#8217;d you chawin&#8217; antelope, and I
thought I&#8217;d wake you up a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little Rifle acquainted the trapper with the principal facts
of their meeting and the subsequent adventures. He listened
with great interest, especially to their adventure in and escape
from the cavern.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the place I went into, a couple of years ago,&#8221;
Old Ruff said, &#8220;and come mighty nigh getting lost the same
as you. But, I didn&#8217;t see nothin&#8217; of that hole in the top,
nor didn&#8217;t diskiver any signs of them other chaps being in
thar. You didn&#8217;t get a fair look at them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; luckily they didn&#8217;t get a fair look at us. They
cleared out before we came out to look around, and we didn&#8217;t
stay to make their acquaintance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you s&#8217;pose they war doing underground?&#8221; asked
Old Ruff, in a significant tone.</p>

<p>The lads replied that they had not the remotest idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thar&#8217;s gold in that cavern, boys, and that&#8217;s what them
chaps war in thar for. I don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose they own any more
of Oregon than we do, and sometime I&#8217;ll go into that big
cellar and take a look around ag&#8217;in. Mebbe I might git<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
my claws onto some of the yaller stuff. Afore you go back
to the fort, Harry, we&#8217;ll take a look &#8217;round, and see what
chance thar is for a spec; but if it happens that we don&#8217;t
get the time to do it, why you can come down ag&#8217;in from
the fort and we&#8217;ll fix it then, sure. If there&#8217;s gold thar <i>you</i>
shall have your chance in, lad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harry now became aware of something which he could
not understand, and which caused him no little uneasiness.
He found that Old Ruff was covertly watching him, as
though he held some kind of a suspicion, regarding his
presence so far away from the fort. Once or twice, when
he hastily raised his eyes, he saw the keen orbs of the trapper
fixed upon him, with a sharp, penetrating glance.</p>

<p>More than once, Harry was tempted to ask the meaning
of this; but he noted that Old Ruff took particular pains to
conceal his surveillance, and this made him fearful of offending
him.</p>

<p>There was a change too&mdash;though comparatively slight&mdash;in
the deportment of Little Rifle. Now that they were reinforced
by the shaggy old trapper, he appeared desirous of
withdrawing into the background, and forcing the hunter to
take his place in the familiar confidence with Harry.</p>

<p>When the latter addressed or approached him, he manifested
a singular coyness&mdash;his face flushed with embarrassment,
while he frequently permitted his gaze to drop to the
ground or turned his head away altogether.</p>

<p>Outwardly old Robsart was all friendship, and was in his
best mood. He recounted many of his adventures in catching
and taming bears, for which, as is well known, he had a
great passion.</p>

<p>Before resuming their journey homeward, Old Ruff resolved
upon an observation from the top of the ridge.</p>

<p>Accordingly all three made their way to the crest. Harry
produced his telescope, and a very careful reconnoissance followed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV.<br />


<span class="small">A TOUGH STORY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Several</span> miles distant, in the heart of a dense pine forest,
was the camp-fire of a party of Indians. Old Ruff, taking
the glass, saw by its aid the smoke making its way through
the tree-tops; but he bestowed hardly a glance upon it, for
he was in search of more important parties.</p>

<p>Turning the instrument toward the banks of the river, it
was not many minutes before he descried two men, making
their way among the rocks and undergrowth in the direction
of the point indicated as the one from which the lads had
made their exit.</p>

<p>The clumps of bushes, huge rocks, and here and there a
few trees, intervened so frequently, and the men were picking
their way with so much caution, that it was only now and
then Old Ruff was able to get a fair look at them; but he
succeeded in discovering that both were white men, dressed
somewhat like Indians, and he was able also to keep himself
informed of the general direction taken by them. When still
several hundred yards from the river, they halted. Old Ruff
could see it was near some shrubbery, which concealed their
movements and hid them from his view.</p>

<p>He held the glass pointed fully ten minutes toward them,
but still they remained invisible.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the spot!&#8221; he exclaimed to himself, as he lowered
the instrument, and looked at it sharply with the unaided eye,
until he felt he had fixed it in his memory. &#8220;There&#8217;s the
door to one of the cellars where Oregon has stored something
rich, and into which Old Ruff Robsart means to take a peep
one of these days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing remained now to be done but to resume their
journey toward their own lodge, and the three descended the
ridge, Old Robsart taking the lead and the boys following silently.
A half-hour later they reached the stream, beside
which Little Rifle was walking when we introduced him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
our readers in the first chapter. Here a canoe was drawn
from its concealment, and the three entered and were paddled
across by Old Ruff, who was in an especially good-natured
and humorous mood.</p>

<p>When they once more placed their feet upon <i>terra firma</i>,
he took great care to conceal the boat, so that it would not
be likely to attract the eye of any one unless he stumbled directly
upon it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I used to cut my name on my boats,&#8221; he said in explanation,
&#8220;so that the varmints could know what chap they belonged
to, and consequently what trouble he&#8217;d get into if he
ran away with &#8217;em; but you see the varmints ain&#8217;t well up
in their eddycation, and I s&#8217;pose they sometimes thought it
was thar names instead of mine. Leastways they run off
with so many of &#8217;em that it bu&#8217;sted me for a time, and arter
that I&#8217;ve made it a practice to hide &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hide whom?&#8221; asked Harry, with a laugh&mdash;&#8220;the canoes
or the Indians?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Both, whenever I got the chance, but thar&#8217;s one question
I could never settle in my mind, and you seem to be rather
a cute chap, mebbe you kin settle it for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do the best I can,&#8221; replied the lad; &#8220;let me hear
what it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A couple of years ago thar was a Government expedition
sent out here, and they engaged me as scout and hunter for
&#8217;em. They had a couple of india-rubber boats with &#8217;em, that
had a powerful stretchiness in &#8217;em. They used to roll &#8217;em up
when they was in camp, and play football with &#8217;em, and then
stretch &#8217;em out for tents at night. So you see they war
mighty handy any way you fixed it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of them,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;and I think if I had
had one of them when I went over the falls, I might have
bounded out again. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m bound to try it if I ever get
the chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, they tied &#8217;em up one night, on the shore of a purty
good-sized stream, intending to cross over at daylight; but
while all war asleep, a Nez Perce Injin stole up and crawled
into one. I s&#8217;pose he meant to steal what he could lay his
hands on, and the first thing he grabbed was a whisky bottle.
One snuff of that settled his hash, and he never stopped guzzling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
till he had swallered the last drop, by which time he
was so drunk he couldn&#8217;t set up, so he tumbled over into the
bottom of the boat and went to sleep. I happened to be on
the watch on the other side the camp, and the feller that was
guardin&#8217; here didn&#8217;t hear nothin&#8217; of what was goin&#8217; on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something or other was the matter with the boat. I
s&#8217;pose like as not it wasn&#8217;t fastened as it orter been, fur the
current worked it loose, and about a couple of hours afore
daylight it went off down-stream.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course in the mornin&#8217; we found out what had happened,
and I see&#8217;d, too, how it had come to git loose, and
a couple of us started on a hunt arter it. We found it about
three miles down the river, where it had cotched fast ag&#8217;in&#8217;
the limb of a tree, and we got in and tried to paddle it back.
The Nez Perce was still sound asleep, and we took him along.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that was the greatest job I ever undertook,&#8221; added
Old Ruff, with a sigh. &#8220;At the first off I sot down in the
bow, and begun to paddle. I thought I was gittin&#8217; along
powerful well, but when I turned my head I found the starn
hadn&#8217;t budged a bit. It had jist staid whar it was when we
started, and the blamed thing was jist stretching out&mdash;stretching
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you want me to tell why it did so?&#8221; said Harry;
&#8220;the rear of the boat must have remained fast in the limbs
of the tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knowed that as well as you do, but that ain&#8217;t the question
at all. I&#8217;ll come to that bimeby. I unfastened the
cotch, and then squatted in the starn and paddled harder
than ever. I worked so hard, that I kept the rear part goin&#8217;
faster than the forrard, so that now and then I hit my
nose ag&#8217;in the prow. That made it bulge into the qu&#8217;arest
kind of shapes, and it bounced about so much that I didn&#8217;t
git along very fast. But at last, I reached camp, whar thar
was a good deal of fun when they found we had brought
the Injin back with us. Some wanted to skulp him on the
spot, but Colonel Stebbins said no. He hadn&#8217;t committed
murder, but he had been cotched at burglary, and we should
try &#8217;im on that charge.</p>

<p>&#8220;So they got up what they called a court-martial, the
colonel himself acting as boss&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>&#8220;Judge Advocate, he is called,&#8221; interrupted Harry, who
was becoming quite interested in the narration.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, and they had their lawyers, or whatever you&#8217;ve a
mind to name &#8217;em, and the Injin was fotched up. By that
time he had worked off most of the whisky. He wasn&#8217;t
sober, not by no means, but he was just drunk enough to be
independent and sassy, and he was the smartest red-skin I
ever sot eyes on. He could talk English as well as we, and
he understood what they war drivin&#8217; at from the fust.</p>

<p>&#8220;When they axed him to pick out a lawyer, he shook his
head, and said he could lie as fast as any lawyer. That
made &#8217;em all laugh, and I could see that they didn&#8217;t mean
to hurt the varmint. If he&#8217;d been a Blackfoot it would have
gone hard with him, for they had bothered us a good deal;
but the Nez Perces had never troubled us afore, and they&#8217;re
a much better set of people anyway.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never could understand what made that red-skin so
smart,&#8221; said Old Ruff, with a wondering shake of his head,
&#8220;it beat my ca&#8217;clations all holler.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any thing particularly smart in what he did,&#8221;
said Harry, &#8220;unless it may have been that he got hold of a
bottle of whisky before you did. I suppose it takes a smart
man to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Robsart looked down upon the impudent lad, with
one of his most patronizing grins. He felt that he was a
sharp one, and he liked him all the better for it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity we hadn&#8217;t <i>you</i> there,&#8221; he said; &#8220;if we had,
things would have gone different, but nobody was around as
cute as you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us hear how the trial resulted, and I beg pardon
for my ill manners.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, Colonel Stebbins was a big, fat, jolly chap, and he
see&#8217;d the fun ahead. So he had the red-skin fotched up
afore him, and he read a paper full of big-sounding words,
that I don&#8217;t b&#8217;l&#8217;eve he understood himself; but when he
got through he told the varmint that he was accused of running
away with a boat that belonged to the United States, and
he axed him what he had got to say in his defense.</p>

<p>&#8220;The red-skin give a hiccup or two, and then said he
didn&#8217;t run away with the boat at all. That he got into it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
to take a nap, and when he woke up, he found it had run
away with him, and he thought the Great Father of the
red-men in Washington orter send him some presents for the
outrage he had suffered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, when he said that, thar was a screech through the
camp, that almost lifted the ha&#8217;r off my head and Colonel
Stebbins shook so hard, that the top of the barrel he was
sittin&#8217; on broke through, and droppin&#8217; a couple of feet down
into it, he got wedged so fast he couldn&#8217;t get out. While
two or three of his officers was tryin&#8217; to pull him and the
barrel apart, the Injin gave the hoops a whack with his
tomahawk, that made the staves fly apart, and let him out
ag&#8217;in.</p>

<p>&#8220;When things had got sobered down a little, the colonel
put him on his trial for stealing a bottle of whisky, and I&#8217;ll
be shot ef he didn&#8217;t deny it right squar&#8217;, and then ax the
officer to prove it on him. Who see&#8217;d him do it? Whar
was the man? He axed him to be fotched. That was another
stunner, and all Colonel Stebbins could do, when he
got over laughin&#8217;, was to ax the red-skin, whar he got the
liquor that made him drunk, and that all could smell on him
that minute. With another hiccup, he said that wasn&#8217;t nobody&#8217;s
business, and he&#8217;d see &#8217;em all hanged fust, and then
he turned round and axed the colonel whar he got the
whisky that <i>he</i> got drunk on.</p>

<p>&#8220;That turned the laugh on him, and fur fifteen minutes,
the other officers rolled over on the ground, and the colonel
had to hold his sides to keep from bu&#8217;stin&#8217;. When he got
things kind of quieted down, he told the red-skin that the
charges wa&#8217;n&#8217;t sustained and he might go; but afore he left
camp, the officers gave him a half-dozen blankets, a new
rifle, ammunition, beads, trinkets till he could hardly carry
&#8217;em all. You see he had got the best of &#8217;em all so well,
that they liked him, and war willing to do any thing in the
world for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And was that the last you heard of him?&#8221; asked Little
Rifle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not by a long shot; that night the confounded scamp
stole into camp, run off two of the best horses we had, and
come powerful near scalping Colonel Stebbins himself.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>&#8220;What was it that prevented?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The colonel wore a wig, and when the Nez Perce grabbed
his hair, you see it come off without using his knife. So
he stuck a couple of eagle-feathers in the top, and set on the
head of one of the mules, and then skedaddled. I&#8217;ve always
&#8217;spicioned that that Injin had white blood in him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His stealing the whisky bottle looks very much like
it. Was <i>that</i> the question you wished me to settle?&#8221; asked
Harry.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I come near forgettin&#8217; it. What I wanted to ask
was, whether in law that varmint run away with the boat, or
whether it run away with him. I&#8217;ve often thought of it
since, but have never been able to make out which way it
would be. How do you think it would be decided down in
Fr&#8217;isco?&#8221;</p>

<p>Harry Northend was not a little amused at the intense seriousness
of Old Ruff, as he referred the question to him. It
was not to be supposed, however, that his head was very clear
upon such knotty points, and he frankly admitted his inability
to decide.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll put the question to some of them chaps down in
Fr&#8217;isco the first time I&#8217;m there, and stop bothering my head
over the blamed thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be sure and put the question to two separate ones,&#8221; said
Harry, &#8220;first giving each ten dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What fur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because one will decide the Indian guilty, and the other
will decide him innocent. Thus you will get satisfaction
from one of them at least, no matter how you look at it yourself.
You will pay your money, and can take your choice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we are at home!&#8221; exclaimed Little Rifle.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI.<br />


<span class="small">THE HAND OF FATE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> lodge of old Robsart and Little Rifle has been already
sufficiently described in these pages, without requiring any
further reference from us. It was near mid-day when it was
reached, and the three decided to spend several hours where
they were, as there was no necessity of setting their traps until
nightfall.</p>

<p>Little Rifle passed to his apartment in the rear of the lodge,
and Harry felt a little hurt that he was not invited to accompany
him. However, he carefully concealed his feelings, and
sitting down in a lazy attitude proceeded to examine the rifle
which had been presented to him.</p>

<p>He found it to be an excellent one, well made and finely
ornamented. It had doubtless been given to the Blackfoot
by some kind-hearted Peace Commissioner, who most likely
formed the first target upon which the red-skin had tried his
skill. As he was also furnished with an abundance of ammunition,
Harry was ready to start on his return to the fort.</p>

<p>The reserve of Little Rifle and the suspicions of the old
trapper almost decided him to go at once, with a mere formal
good-by. While he was examining his weapon, he could
feel that the eyes of the old trapper were upon him, and it
nettled him not a little to think that any white man should
entertain any distrust regarding him.</p>

<p>Unable to conjecture the cause, he concluded that the best
thing he could do was to relieve them of his presence.</p>

<p>All at once he sprung to his feet, and slung the rifle over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll go now,&#8221; he said, in his off-hand manner;
&#8220;they will begin to wonder at my absence from the fort. I
can reach there by night, if I make good use of my time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Ruff, who was carefully arranging some sticks so as to
prepare a fire, looked up at him, without the least appearance
of surprise. Indeed, Harry fancied that there was something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
in his looks which said plainly enough that he was pleased to
hear his words.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gettin&#8217; purty well on into the day, younker, and
you&#8217;d better wait till mornin&#8217; afore you start on such a
tramp.&#8221;</p>

<p>Regarding this invitation as insincere, Harry paid no heed
to it, and had actually taken several steps on his way, when
Little Rifle unexpectedly put in an appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you must go, Harry,&#8221; said he, as he stepped forth into
the open air, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go with you until you&#8217;re within sight of
the fort. It is a good ways from here, and you know what
danger there is to pass through. I should never forgive myself
if any thing should happen to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harry was touched at this generous offer, and he felt all
his resentment vanish on the instant, to be succeeded by his
tender, loving affection for the lad who had already so generously
risked his life for him.</p>

<p>He looked toward old Robsart, who he expected would object
to any such proceeding, but he seemed to be as willing
to this arrangement as to any thing else. Indeed he showed
that he looked upon it with favor, for he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Take the straightest course you can foller, younkers, for
you will need all your time. But see here, Little Rifle, I
want to say a word or two to you afore you go.&#8221;</p>

<p>There could be no legitimate objection to this, but it disturbed
Harry, as he saw the two walk away, side by side, for
a rod or two, and then, standing with their backs to him, engage
in a cautious but earnest conversation.</p>

<p>He did not hear a word, but, as he looked that way, he
could see both gesticulating, the old trapper being much more
excited than the younger, who from appearances was mildly
expostulating against some of his utterances.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is none of my concern,&#8221; muttered Harry, &#8220;what secrets
they may have between themselves. I never saw either
until yesterday, and may never see them again, but they have
had no cause to show any suspicion toward me. I <i>do</i> feel
drawn toward Little Rifle by an irresistible emotion. There
is so much true nobility in his nature, he is so wonderfully
handsome, and he has such rare mental powers that it is a
sin to keep him away here in these solitudes, away from all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
creation. I&#8217;ll have a good talk with him on the way to the
fort, and if he has got any ambition in his nature I&#8217;ll rouse
it, and make him go back East with me. I will get father
to adopt and educate him, and we&#8217;ll make a man of him in a
few years&mdash; Helloa! here he comes, walking as if he was
in a great hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Ruff came forward too, and taking the hand of the
boy said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect to be over to the fort in a few days, arter hosses
to take my peltries away, so I won&#8217;t say good-by to you, only
I wish you good luck, and keep your eye open for varmints.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harry returned the salutation, in his pleasant manner, and
then, as both he and Little Rifle waved the old man farewell,
they turned their faces westward and started on their memorable
journey to Fort Abercrombie, neither party, in his wildest
dreamings, suspecting what a passing strange adventure
should befall them ere they were to catch sight of the Stars
and Stripes, that waved from the flagstaff of this frontier post.</p>

<p>When they had reached a point about a mile distant, a very
perceptible change in the sky became apparent. The sun
was hid by clouds that swiftly drifted up from the Cascade
Range, and the air which had been mild and balmy, rapidly
grew colder, until the lads were compelled to walk quite
briskly to keep up the circulation and warmth of the body.
The wind blew strongly, whistling and moaning among the
trees like the blasts of winter, and there was every indication
of a great elemental disturbance.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a storm coming, as sure as fate,&#8221; said Harry,
looking up at the threatening sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if it were a snow storm,&#8221; added
Little Rifle. &#8220;I have seen them come up as suddenly as this
before. Hadn&#8217;t we better go back, and stay in our lodge
over night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather go on,&#8221; replied Harry, who dreaded the
annoyance of being covertly watched by the old trapper, for
an indefinite number of hours. &#8220;If the storm becomes too
severe, why we can go into camp and wait until it blows over.
Do you think it will amount to much?&#8221;</p>

<p>Little Rifle looked up to the sky, with the air and manner
of a weather prophet, and replied:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>&#8220;No; I think it is a sudden flurry, or a squall that will be
over in an hour; but you notice how chilly it is; we ought
to be provided with blankets, at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can stand it if you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only spoke on your account,&#8221; said Little Rifle as they
started forward. &#8220;We can walk fast, and that will keep us
warm, and if it gets too cold for us to stand it, we will crawl
in among the rocks somewhere and build a rousing fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harry found the walk brisk enough to suit the most enthusiastic
pedestrian, and it speedily sent a glow of warmth all
through his system.</p>

<p>A moment after several feathery flakes of snow drifted
against their faces, and then scarcely five minutes had elapsed
when the air was full. Millions and billions of the white
flakes, some of them of large size, were eddying and whirling
all about them. When they looked up, they could barely
keep their eyes open, and they were literally blinded by
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jingo! this is rather sudden,&#8221; shouted Harry with a
laugh. &#8220;I guess the Coast Range has blowed up, and sent
the pieces this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The snow drove against them and filled the air so entirely
that the boys could not see a rod ahead of them. Little Rifle,
however, was able to recall where they were, and he groped
forward, until they reached the shelter of some rocks, where
they could remain until the snow-squall should terminate.</p>

<p>As they stood there, looking out upon the beautiful snow,
Little Rifle reached out and took the gun of Harry for the
purpose of making a more minute examination of it than he
had yet done.</p>

<p>&#8220;While you&#8217;re doing that I&#8217;ll take a look at that handsome
little piece of yours. Helloa!&#8221;</p>

<p>As Harry took it in his hand, he grasped the stock in a
peculiar manner&mdash;very differently from what he would have
done at any other time, and, as he did so, he pressed something
or other that caused a little lid beneath the trigger-guard
to fly open.</p>

<p>And while Little Rifle was staring wonderingly at this
hitherto unknown contrivance, Harry reached one thumb and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
finger in, and drew out a small twist of paper. On it, he saw
written a few words, in faded ink.</p>

<p><i>And these words told the secret of Little Rifle&#8217;s birth, history
and life!</i></p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII.<br />


<span class="small">WOOING IN THE WILDERNESS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Rifle</span> stood pale and breathless, as he saw Harry
Northend draw the slip of paper from the secret recess in the
stock of his gun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I read it?&#8221; asked Harry in a husky voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the whispered answer.</p>

<p>And he read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;On the completion of her second birthday, I presented this
rifle to my beloved daughter Hagar. Providence has ordained
that a portion of her life shall be spent in the wilderness, and
it may be of some use to her in the future. Her mother died
at her birth and she is my only child. I am compelled to go
on a long journey that may separate her from me for years,
and I leave her in charge of Maquesa, the Indian chief who is
my friend tried and true.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jared Ravenna.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>When Harry had completed the reading of this extraordinary
slip he folded it up and carefully replaced it in the small
opening, and closed the cunningly contrived lid, and then
looked at his companion, who, still pale, and now shivering
in every limb, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Harry, you have discovered my secret; Hagar Ravenna
is my name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are not a boy, but a girl, and the most beautiful
one that I ever laid eyes upon. I did not suspect <i>that</i>, and I
now understand your bashfulness, and the suspicion with
which Old Ruff looked upon me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; he had great fears that you suspected my sex, and
when we were on the point of starting, did his best to dissuade
me against going with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you regret that you came?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>&#8220;No, else I might have lived and died in ignorance of my
real name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now that you have heard it pronounced, is there any
thing in it, that sounds familiar&mdash;that brings up past memories?
<i>Hagar!</i> think of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little Rifle looked off in the blinding snow with a dim,
vacant, wandering look, as if she were seeking to awaken long-forgotten
memories. She stood thus, silent and abstracted, for
several minutes, and then spoke in a low, hushed voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there is something in the sound of the word that
struck my ear, as though I had heard it before, and it calls up
again the picture that I sometimes see in my dreams, of a
great ship sailing over the water; but the picture is dim and
shadowy, and I do not know whether it is only the outlines
of a dream that came to me sometime, away back in childhood,
perhaps when I lay asleep in the lodge of the Indian
chief, Maquesa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is reality&mdash;I know it,&#8221; said the excited Harry; &#8220;you
have a father living somewhere in the world, and there is a
future opening before you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how is he to be found?&#8221; asked Little Rifle. &#8220;He
may be thousands of miles away; or, it may be that he came
back years ago, and finding nothing of me has given me up
as dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may all be, and it may not. But, do you wish to
live the life of a savage in the woods? Don&#8217;t you ever want
to go among civilized beings and become one of them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have often dreamed and often wished,&#8221; she answered,
lowering her eyes, and looking at the snow-flakes, which were
drifting against her moccasins.</p>

<p>&#8220;And your dream shall become a reality. Go with me to
the fort and wait till father comes, and you shall go back
with us; you shall be educated, and then what woman shall
equal you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And supposing my father is never found&mdash;how shall I
ever repay your father and you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The fine dark eyes of Harry Northend glowed with a radiant
light, as he leaned forward, and placing his arm around
the neck of Little Rifle, imprinted a warm kiss upon her
cheek, and said, in low, ardent tones:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>&#8220;By becoming my wife, and thus I shall be repaid a thousand
times over. I understand now how it was that, when I
looked up in your face, as I began to recover my senses, after
you had dragged me from the water below the falls, a
feeling shot through me like the shock of electricity. It puzzled
me to understand what it meant; I thought yours was
the handsomest face I ever looked upon, and it often seemed
to me that there was a feminine delicacy and refinement about
you, in spite of the uncivilized life you were leading. I found,
too, that your manner and conversation proved that you had
received a partial education. But above all, your heroic character,
as you showed it when you leaped into the water, drew
me toward you as the pole draws the magnet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was puzzled and not a little hurt,&#8221; continued the impassioned
Harry, as he still kept one arm around the neck of
Little Rifle, and held her hand imprisoned in his own, &#8220;at
your shyness, especially after Old Ruff appeared upon the
scene. It seemed to me that I was distrusted by both of you,
but now I can understand that it was only your instinctive
maidenly modesty, and I honor you for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cheeks of the beautiful girl (as Little Rifle must henceforth
be regarded) grew rosier and redder, and now flushed to
scarlet, as she never once raised her eyes from the ground, and
Harry poured out his burning, impassioned words.</p>

<p>&#8220;But with the discovery of the secret comes the discovery
that I love you, with my whole heart and soul. I feel that
my future is to be linked with yours; if I could know this
minute that we were to be separated, I would want to die.
Let me pledge my love to you and receive yours&mdash;or the
promise of it at some future time, and then we will turn to
the great future that opens before us. We are both young
yet. Everybody persists in calling me a boy, and I suppose
I am, but it can&#8217;t last much longer. If my life is spared, no
one can hinder me from becoming a man, and you are younger
yet than I, and we shall only think of marriage as something
that is to come after awhile. Sometime, when every thing is
ready, I shall wed you&mdash;you shall be my bride of the wilderness.
What do you say, Little Rifle? Are you prepared to
give me any encouragement?&#8221;</p>

<p>It would seem all natural and proper that this wooing and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
winning should have reached its successful conclusion at once&mdash;that
the beautiful forest girl should have acknowledged her
love at once, and confessed that her future would be hopeless
unless it echoed back the prayer of her ardent lover. But,
she was truthful, and possessed rare good sense. Loving old
Robsart had given her the clothes of a hunter to wear, as
soon as she was able to go about, and had carefully concealed
the knowledge of her sex from those with whom they happened
to come in contact.</p>

<p>This undoubtedly was wise, as it saved her from annoying
attentions and perhaps insult at the hands of the rough borderers,
who occasionally saw her; but the old mountaineer
had given her, after his own peculiar fashion, considerable
knowledge of &#8220;society&#8221; and its usages.</p>

<p>And then her own instinctive maidenly sense told her that
she had no means of knowing she really returned the love of
the noble young fellow at her side. Gratitude and friendship
she knew entered into her emotions, but she could not feel
positive that there was any thing more.</p>

<p>She spoke, therefore, as her conscience dictated:</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know that I understand what love is&mdash;that is, as
you look upon it.&#8221; She spoke in a low, soft, but unhesitating
manner, with her eyes still upon the ground. &#8220;I know
that I think a great deal of you&mdash;that I would risk my life at
any time to keep you from harm. I am so fond of you, indeed,
that I can not deceive you by saying that I love you,
when I am not sure about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was disappointing to Harry, but, as a moment&#8217;s reflection
revealed to him the admirable spirit which prompted
it, he could but respect and love her all the more.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was wrong in pressing you to answer such a question,
before you had time to think over it. Let it go for the
present, and I will wait until you are fully ready. But I
can not deny myself asking one thing more.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused a moment as if waiting for permission, and she
raised her wonderfully handsome eyes and looked in his
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I want to ask, Little Rifle, is whether you are willing
to give me a promise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask me whatever you wish.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>&#8220;If you say you are unable to know, in your own heart,
what the nature of love is, of course there is no one who has
a place before me in your affections?&#8221;</p>

<p>The face of the girl expanded into a smile, as she answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not; how could there be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know but what the old man was jealous of
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now the smile broke forth into musical, heartfelt laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does love put such funny dreams as that into your head?
How could such a thing as that be? I am a child, and he a
man well on in years. He often looks at me, and says something
about my growing so fast, and says, too, that it only
seems a year ago that he found me in the lodge of the Indian
chief, and he declares that he shall always look upon me as
that same little child. He loves me, indeed, as your father
loves you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no objection to that,&#8221; replied Harry, with a prodigious
sigh of relief, &#8220;so it don&#8217;t grow on him too fast. But what I
want to ask, Little Rifle, is whether you are willing to give
me a promise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I will promise any thing I can,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;If ever, in the future, you are ready to love any one, will
you remember me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure I can make that pledge,&#8221; she answered, with a
glowing smile. &#8220;In the whole broad world there can never
be any one who can take a place before you in my affections.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is all I can ask,&#8221; exclaimed the delighted Harry
kissing her warm cheek again and again. &#8220;I look upon you
now as promised to me; that sweet thought shall ever be within
me&mdash;it shall cheer me onward, and after my probation is
ended, after you have learned more of the world than you
now know, you shall see how great was my love for you.
Bless you, my dearest Bride of the Wilderness!&#8221;</p>

<p>They had spent a much longer time than they supposed, in
the natural excitement and agitation resulting from the discovery,
and they had proceeded but a short distance on their
journey when both saw that it would be impossible for them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
to reach the fort until late at night; so they pressed forward
now, as if to make up for the sweet moments lost.</p>

<p>Pressing on, night overtook them, and yet the fort was far
away; so nothing remained but to choose a cosy spot and to
go into camp for the night. This course Little Rifle advised
as the gathering dusk rendered all the wood-paths obscure,
and she began at once to look out for a safe retreat, not among
the rocks and woods around, but down in a ravine, into which
the girl-guide, to Harry&#8217;s surprise, now worked her way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we shall find wood and every thing in readiness,&#8221;
she said in explanation; &#8220;for Uncle Ruff and I have made
our camp here two or three times, during the past few
months.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they went down deeper and deeper into the gorge, the
darkness became so intense that Harry was only enabled to follow
his guide by the sound of her moccasins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we are,&#8221; she finally said, in a low voice; &#8220;stand
quiet a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>He could hear her moving about, for several minutes, when
she spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;All is ready; strike a match, and we shall have a fire
right away.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Harry drew out his match-safe he found that only two
lucifers were in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;By jingo! suppose both of them go out!&#8221; he exclaimed,
in a terrified whisper; &#8220;here goes!&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, he drew the phosphorus swiftly along his
sleeve, when it broke into a blaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you, Little Rifle?&#8221; he asked, looking anxiously
around, and then, seeing her kneeling upon the ground, with
the wood ready, he did the same, and at that instant, a puff
of wind blew out the tiny flame, leaving both in blank darkness
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; whistled the lad, in genuine alarm, &#8220;only one
match left! If that misses, we&#8217;re in a pretty scrape.&#8221;</p>

<p>It would be difficult to imagine the anxiety of the two, as,
kneeling close together, and shutting out the wind as much as
possible, the last remaining match was struck.</p>

<p>Little Rifle had gathered dry leaves, which caught and
burned readily. Others were carefully piled upon them, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
by nursing the flame for several minutes, the eyes of the two
friends lit up with joy, as they saw a bright, warm, crackling
fire blaze up before them.</p>

<p>Then, as it lit up the gloom, Harry could see the signs of a
camp having been held upon this spot sometime before. There
was an abundance of fuel, and had they possessed blankets,
they could not have desired to be more comfortable.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall have more snow to-night,&#8221; said Little Rifle, looking
up to the sky; &#8220;there is no moon or stars, and I can feel
it in the air.&#8221;</p>

<p>They broke off branches and limbs, and spreading them
upon the ground, made as comfortable lounges as possible under
the circumstances; but still, although the day had been
warm, there was a growing chilliness in the night air, which
made them keep the fire roaring as much as was compatible
with safety.</p>

<p>And sitting close together, near this, they renewed and continued
their conversation for hours. They talked of the future&mdash;Harry
painted in rosy colors what both were due, and
what happiness was to come to both in the end.</p>

<p>And Little Rifle listened, pleased and charmed, until the
voice of the lad grew broken and uncertain, his head drooped,
and he finally sunk over upon his bed of twigs and branches,
in a sound slumber.</p>

<p>He was awakened by something cold and soft that struck
him lightly in the face. Opening his eyes and starting up, he
found that the camp-fire had smoldered to ashes; he was cold
and chilly, and Little Rifle was gone!</p>

<p>His first proceeding was to start up and throw more wood
upon the fire. When he had driven the numbness from his
system, he then began to look for the return of Little Rifle,
and to wonder what her long absence, as shown by the condition
of the camp-fire, meant.</p>

<p>But hour after hour wore away and she came not, while a
strange vague fear stole over the lad, as he called her by
name again and again, and no response came.</p>

<p>That which had struck him in the face and awaked him
was a snowflake, or rather a score of them, and, as he looked
about, he saw that the air was full of snow, falling softly
and silently, and wrapping the earth in its robe of white.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>At last the dull gray morning broke, and still no signs of
Little Rifle.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can have happened?&#8221; exclaimed the distressed
Harry. &#8220;She is gone! she is lost! I have lost my beautiful
Bride of the Wilderness!&#8221;</p>

<p>Alas! he spoke the truth!</p>

<p>In &#8220;Old Ruff, the Trapper,&#8221; Star Novel No. 110, the Adventures
of the Young Fur-Hunters will be completed. Old
Ruff&#8217;s great hunts with his pet bear, Spotted Ben, will play
principal parts in this last and best great story of the hunter-author.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &bull; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
